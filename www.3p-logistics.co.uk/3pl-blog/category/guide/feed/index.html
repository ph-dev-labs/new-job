										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an ecommerce business owner, you likely spend a significant amount of time analysing your store&#8217;s metrics, such as conversion rate, bounce rate, and revenue. However, one metric that is often overlooked but holds significant importance is the average order value (AOV). In this guide, we will explain what AOV is, how to calculate it, and how to increase it to maximise your ecommerce revenue.</p>
<h2>Understanding Average Order Value (AOV) and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>AOV is the average amount of money a customer spends on your website per order. AOV is an essential metric for ecommerce businesses because it directly impacts the bottom line. By increasing the AOV, you can generate more revenue without necessarily increasing the number of orders or traffic to your website. This means you can maximize your revenue without incurring additional marketing or acquisition costs.</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Your Store&#8217;s AOV</h2>
<p>To calculate your store&#8217;s AOV, you need to divide the total revenue generated by the number of orders. You can find this information in your ecommerce platform&#8217;s analytics or by exporting a sales report. For example, if your store generated £20,000 in revenue from 200 orders, your AOV would be £100. It&#8217;s important to calculate your AOV regularly and track changes over time. This will help you identify trends and adjust your strategies accordingly.</p>
<h2>How AOV Impacts Business Decisions</h2>
<p>Raising your average order value (AOV) offers more benefits than just boosting your revenue. It can also enhance the efficiency of your entire business.</p>
<p>By gaining deeper insights into your customers and boosting your conversion rates, you can optimise your advertising budget and implement a more beneficial pricing strategy for both you and your clients. AOV serves as a critical indicator of overall business performance, and it can be a valuable tool to increase cash flow in other areas of the business, thereby boosting overall revenue.</p>
<h3>Marketing Strategies</h3>
<p>By knowing your AOV, you can determine how much you can afford to spend on customer acquisition. For example, if your AOV is £100, and you spend £50 on advertising to acquire a customer, you will need to generate two orders to break even.</p>
<h3>Inventory Management</h3>
<p>AOV can also help you manage your inventory. By analysing which products are frequently purchased together, you can bundle them and increase AOV.</p>
<h3>Pricing strategy</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take your store&#8217;s AOV into account when making changes to your pricing strategy. If you see an increase in AOV and maintain or improve your return on investment (ROI) after adjusting your prices, then you&#8217;re on the right track. Although some brands are hesitant to raise prices out of fear that it will reduce conversion rates and turn off customers, the impact of price changes can vary depending on how your brand is perceived by consumers. Some brands are seen as luxury brands, while others are known for offering discounts. Finding the right balance can be challenging and may raise concerns about profit margins.</p>
<h2>What Impacts Your Store&#8217;s AOV?</h2>
<p>Several factors can impact your store&#8217;s AOV, including:</p>
<h3>Product Selection</h3>
<p>The selection of products you offer also impacts your AOV. If you only offer low-priced items, customers may not see the value in purchasing multiple products, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering higher-priced items or product bundles can encourage customers to spend more, resulting in a higher AOV. Additionally, offering a variety of products that appeal to different customer needs and preferences can increase the likelihood of customers purchasing more items.</p>
<h3>Website Design</h3>
<p>The design and layout of your website can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. A poorly designed website can be confusing and frustrating for customers, leading to a lower AOV. A well-designed website that is easy to navigate, with clear product descriptions and images, can encourage customers to spend more time browsing and ultimately lead to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering personalised product recommendations and easy-to-use search and filter options can help customers find products they are interested in and increase the likelihood of purchasing more items.</p>
<h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
<p>The cost of shipping can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. High shipping costs can discourage customers from purchasing multiple items, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering free shipping for orders above a certain threshold can encourage customers to purchase more items to reach that threshold, leading to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering fast and reliable shipping options can increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases, ultimately resulting in a higher AOV.</p>
<h3>Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
<p>If you offer products on a subscription basis and enjoy recurring revenue, along with a solid strategy for retaining repeat customers, you&#8217;re in a great position. This means that you can have a lower average order value (AOV) and allocate more resources towards customer acquisition than brands lacking these features.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: your customer lifetime value is higher than that of brands selling only one product or without a retention strategy. By forecasting that over half of your customers will make repeat purchases or subscribe to a recurring revenue-generating service, you can compute the average lifetime value, which determines the lifetime AOV.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you sell a £10 monthly subscription, and most subscribers stick around for 15 months. In that case, you have a lifetime value of £150, even if your AOV is just £10. This means you can spend more than £10 to acquire a customer, knowing that you can earn an average of £150 from that customer over their time with your brand.</p>
<h3>Product Pricing</h3>
<p>The price of your products has a direct impact on your store&#8217;s average order value (AOV). If your prices are too high, customers may not be willing to purchase as much, resulting in a lower AOV. On the other hand, if your prices are too low, customers may not feel the need to purchase additional items, leading to a lower AOV. Finding the right balance is crucial to increasing your AOV. Consider implementing product bundling or offering discounts for purchasing multiple items to encourage customers to spend more.</p>
<p>It may still be worth considering adjusting your pricing strategy to see if you can cover your cost per conversion.</p>
<p>For instance, increasing your subscription price from £10 to £12 may not significantly impact your conversion rate, but it can generate an additional £24 per customer per year, which could cover your acquisition costs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure that your return on ad spend (ROAS), which is the ratio of cost per conversion to customer lifetime value (CPC:LTV), remains net positive, and the higher the ROAS, the better. Improving your AOV can be an effective method to boost your ROAS because it relies on increasing the amount customers spend during checkout instead of attracting more customers, which can be costly.</p>
<h2>6 Tips to Increase Your Store&#8217;s AOV</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Upselling and cross-selling techniques:</strong> Upselling and cross-selling techniques involve suggesting complementary or higher-priced items to customers. For example, if a customer is purchasing a camera, you could recommend a higher-end model or suggest additional lenses or accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Bundling products:</strong> Bundling products involves grouping complementary items together and offering them at a discounted price. This can encourage customers to purchase multiple items and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Offering free shipping and other incentives:</strong> Offering free shipping or other incentives, such as a free gift with purchase, can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a minimum order value for free shipping:</strong> Offer free shipping for orders over a specific amount. This motivates customers to add more items to their cart to reach the free shipping threshold, thereby increasing the AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Limited-time offers:</strong> Limited-time offers, such as a discount on orders over a certain amount, can encourage customers to purchase more items to take advantage of the offer.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a minimum order value for free shipping:</strong> Offer free shipping for orders over a specific amount. This motivates customers to add more items to their cart to reach the free shipping threshold, thereby increasing the AOV.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s look into some of these points in more detail..</p>
<h2>Upselling and Cross-selling Techniques to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Upselling and cross-selling techniques can be highly effective in increasing AOV. Here are some tips to implement these techniques successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Personalisation:</strong> personalisation is essential in upselling and cross-selling. Use customer data to suggest products that are relevant to their interests and past purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Display recommendations on product pages:</strong> displaying recommendations on product pages can encourage customers to add additional items to their cart.</li>
<li><strong>Use product bundles:</strong> bundling products can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV. For example, if a customer is purchasing a dress, you could suggest matching shoes and accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Offer discounts on bundles:</strong> offering a discount on bundles can make them more appealing to customers and increase AOV.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bundling Products to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Bundling products involves grouping complementary items together and offering them at a discounted price. Here are some tips to bundle products successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose complementary products:</strong> choose products that are often purchased together or are relevant to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Use product images:</strong> use product images to showcase the bundled items and create a visually appealing bundle.</li>
<li><strong>Offer discounts:</strong> offering a discount on bundles can make them more appealing to customers and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Use limited-time offers</strong>: limited-time offers, such as a discount on bundles for a specific period, can create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to purchase.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Offering Free Shipping and Other Incentives to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Offering free shipping and other incentives can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV. Here are some tips to offer free shipping and other incentives successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use minimum spend thresholds:</strong> use minimum spend thresholds to offer free shipping or other incentives. For example, offer free shipping on orders over £50.</li>
<li><strong>Use limited-time offers:</strong> limited-time offers, such as free shipping for a specific period, can encourage customers to purchase more items to take advantage of the offer.</li>
<li><strong>Use pop-ups and banners:</strong> use pop-ups and banners to promote free shipping or other incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Offer incentives for referrals:</strong> offer incentives, such as a discount on the next order, for customers who refer friends or family to your store.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How a 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) Provider Can Help Increase AOV</h2>
<p>A 3PL  provider can help increase AOV by offering additional services, such as:</p>
<h3>Inventory Management</h3>
<p>One of the primary ways a 3PL provider can help increase AOV is through effective inventory management. By utilising advanced inventory management tools, a 3PL provider can help ecommerce businesses reduce the risk of stockouts and overstocks, which can lead to lost sales and wasted resources. Additionally, by leveraging their expertise and technology, a 3PL provider can optimise inventory levels and ensure that popular products are always in stock, thus increasing the likelihood that customers will add additional items to their cart.</p>
<h3>Shipping and Fulfilment</h3>
<p>Another way a 3PL provider can increase AOV is by providing fast and reliable shipping and fulfilment services. Many consumers are willing to pay more for fast-tracked shipping or choose to add additional items to their cart to reach a free shipping threshold. By partnering with a 3PL provider that offers a range of shipping options and has the ability to quickly process and fulfil orders, ecommerce businesses can increase their AOV by encouraging customers to make larger purchases and feel more confident in their overall shopping experience.</p>
<h3>Returns Management</h3>
<p>Lastly, effective returns management is an often overlooked but critical component of increasing AOV. By working with a 3PL provider that offers streamlined returns processing, ecommerce businesses can provide customers with a hassle-free returns experience, which can increase customer loyalty and encourage repeat purchases. Additionally, a 3PL provider can help identify patterns and reasons for returns, which can inform inventory and product selection decisions, leading to better sales performance and ultimately, increased AOV.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Maximizing Your Ecommerce Revenue Through AOV</h2>
<p>In conclusion, AOV is an essential metric for ecommerce businesses. By increasing AOV, you can generate more revenue without necessarily increasing traffic or marketing costs. To increase AOV, implement upselling and cross-selling techniques, bundle products, offer free shipping and other incentives, and consider working with a 3PL provider. Regularly track your AOV and adjust your strategies to maximize your ecommerce revenue.</p>
<h2>Increase your AOV with 3PL</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever eagerly ordered a product online, only to be filled with disappointment when it arrives damaged? It’s an experience which can damage brand reputations and result in losing loyal customers. <strong><em>If you want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your eCommerce brand, discover the best ways to prevent product damage during shipping now…</em></strong></p>
<h2>The importance of packaging your products correctly</h2>
<p>It may seem like an obvious point, but it’s essential that your products are packaged correctly before they are dispatched to customers.</p>
<p>Damaged products not only cause heartache and dissatisfaction for consumers, but they are a real headache for retailers too &#8211; who often have to absorb the cost of replacing damaged items.</p>
<p>It’s not a minor problem, either. According to research carried out by the Citizens Advice Bureau, approximately two in three people (69 per cent) who shop online have ‘had parcels go missing, damaged or turn up late’.</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by research body Statista in 2019 found that damaged products were in the top five reasons for dissatisfaction with online retailers amongst consumers.</p>
<p>Yet another piece of research from packaging company Sealed Air found that approximately 20% of eCommerce returns can be attributed to damage to the product.</p>
<p>It’s clear, then, that product damage during delivery is not only a widespread issue but a serious one amongst consumers.</p>
<p>So, what can you &#8211; as an eCommerce retailer &#8211; do about it? In the next section of this article, the 3PL team will provide you with their top tips to prevent product damage during shipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to prevent your products from being damaged during shipping</h2>
<p>As you’re about to see, there are a wealth of ways in which you can prevent your products from being damaged during shipping. Some are simpler than others, but they all have one thing in common; they’ll result in fewer damaged products and happier customers!</p>
<h3>1. Use quality packaging</h3>
<p>Packaging is one of those areas where it can be all too tempting to cut costs. However, given the volume of returns that can occur as a result of damage, cheap packaging almost always turns out to be a false economy.</p>
<p>Consider using packaging such as corrugated cardboard boxes, custom folding cartons, or rigid boxes, which will provide an enhanced level of protection beyond that which you would get from cheaper packaging materials such as poly bags.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the correct size packaging</h3>
<p>One of the most common reasons for damage to products during shipping is that they’ve been shipped in the packaging of the incorrect size.</p>
<p>Ideally, the box or packaging you use should only be slightly larger than the product you are shipping. The closer you can align the size of your packaging with your products, the better.</p>
<p>For a great example, think about Apple products. The size of their packaging is so closely aligned with the size of their products that they almost have an ‘airtight’ style seal. This ensures the products are maximally protected during shipping.</p>
<p>Having said that, though, you do need to ensure there is enough room for a decent amount of dunnage (dunnage being the packing materials that help cushion the product in the shipping box).</p>
<h3>3. Wrap your products</h3>
<p>This is an especially important point if your products are fragile, prone to breakage, shattering or being scratched or dented.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of product, you’ll want to use a particular type of dunnage (e.g. wrapping material). For example, if you’re sending items such as ceramic mugs, then you’ll want to ensure they are wrapped in very thick bubble wrap in addition to being held in place with cardboard frames to prevent excessive movement.</p>
<h3>4. Fill all empty space</h3>
<p>When we said earlier that you want to reduce the amount of empty space in your packaging, we meant it!</p>
<p>If you can’t completely eliminate empty space in your packaging (e.g. you’re struggling to find boxes that are a very close fit to your product), then you at least want to fill that empty space with protective material.</p>
<p>Think of those times when you’ve opened a package and &#8211; aside from the product &#8211; the box has been filled with packing peanuts, bubble wrap or packing paper. That’s done deliberately to ensure your product is cushioned and arrives with you in one piece.</p>
<h3>5. Use ‘fragile’ labels</h3>
<p>You can significantly reduce the amount of breakage you experience by adding ‘fragile’ labels to your packages.</p>
<p>Make these fragile labels clear enough, and you’ll be giving couriers a clear indication that they need to take care when handling your deliveries!</p>
<h3>6. Use shock absorbing packaging materials</h3>
<p>If you really want to be confident that your products are going to arrive with your customers in one piece, consider investing in shock absorbing packaging materials.</p>
<p>In recent years, shock absorbing packaging materials have become quite advanced, with available solutions including shock absorbing ‘floors’, die-cut foam inserts, and stabilisation blocks.</p>
<p>These materials can significantly reduce the effects of shock and vibration on your products &#8211; which are the key causes of damage to products during transit.</p>
<h3>7. Do a trial run!</h3>
<p>Before you start sending out hundreds of your products, it’s a very good idea to conduct a series of trial runs.</p>
<p>If you have the time, and the inclination, try conducting several trial runs. Send the same product in different packaging variations to see which packaging configuration has the best results.</p>
<p>Should you just be starting out in the world of eCommerce, and you’re still to decide upon a full-time shipping partner, it can also be worthwhile sending some trial packages with a number of different couriers to see what the results are.</p>
<h3>8. Record damage data</h3>
<p>Make it a point to track and record every single incidence of damage that your customers report to you.</p>
<p>Doing this can help you identify common trends. For example, if products are being consistently damaged in a certain way, it may mean the packaging they are being shipped in, isn’t fit for purpose.</p>
<h3>9. Use a quality shipping partner</h3>
<p>If you want to take the hassle out of fulfilling and shipping your products and focus on what you do best &#8211; marketing and selling your goods &#8211; then working with a quality third-party logistics (3PL) company is more than worthwhile.</p>
<p>Third-party logistics providers such as ourselves here at 3PL can take care of your entire fulfilment process, from managing orders, picking and packing your products, and ensuring they reach your customers quickly and in one piece via the best couriers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking of outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider (3PL) this year? It’s a big move, but one that can provide you with significant cost savings, efficiencies and more. But, only if you pick the right 3PL. <strong><em>Find out how to do exactly that in this guide…</em></strong></p>
<h2>Start by assessing your fulfilment requirements</h2>
<p>Before you start shopping around for 3PLs, you should first take the time to assess your requirements.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as asking yourself a series of questions about how your business currently handles fulfilment.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many orders do you fulfil each day?</li>
<li>What kind of products do you fulfil?</li>
<li>Which platforms do you sell on? How are these integrated into your fulfilment process?</li>
<li>How accurate is your inventory management?</li>
<li>How accurate is your fulfilment process?</li>
<li>Which markets do you sell to? Do these include international locations?</li>
<li>What are your growth plans?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions (and more!) will help you to fully understand what you require from a third-party logistics provider.</p>
<h2>Taking the leap: the benefits of outsourcing your fulfilment</h2>
<p>There’s no getting away from the fact that outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider is a big deal. But, it can also bring <strong>big</strong> benefits.</p>
<p>When making the decision as to whether or not you’ll outsource your fulfilment, you should look ahead and consider some important long-term trends:</p>
<h3>The cost of energy</h3>
<p>Firstly, energy prices are currently sky-high &#8211; and are unlikely to decrease anytime soon. If you’re tempted to keep your fulfilment operations in-house, consider that things like warehousing, delivery and general operations are energy-intensive.</p>
<p>Instead, if you outsource your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider, you won’t have to incur the high-energy costs associated with fulfilment.</p>
<h3>Rising costs and inflation</h3>
<p>It’s not just energy that’s become a huge burden for eCommerce businesses to bear. Following the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, global supply chains have fractured.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the cost of raw materials rising significantly. This has had the knock-on effect of increasing inflation and labour costs.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your fulfilment in 2023, you can avoid many of these costs as you won’t have to employ an in-house fulfilment team.</p>
<p>These are not the only ways in which outsourcing fulfilment can save your business money. However, they are the most pressing trends facing eCommerce brands.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guide &#8211; to discover more ways outsourcing fulfilment can save you money, </em></strong><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/how-can-outsourcing-to-3pl-help-your-business-cut-costs/"><strong><em>read our complete guide now</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>
<h2>How to select the best 3PL for your business</h2>
<p>As you’ve just read, outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL can have a positive impact on your brand’s profitability, operations, efficiencies and more.</p>
<p><strong><em>But, only if you select the right 3PL. </em></strong>Make the wrong decision and things can go badly wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, to help you select the best 3PL partner for your business, we’ve outlined our top requirements to look for below.</p>
<h3>Omnichannel expertise</h3>
<p>These days, it’s rare for eCommerce brands to restrict their sales and marketing efforts to their website.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise of online marketplaces (e.g., Amazon) and social commerce (e.g., shopfronts on TikTok, Instagram and others), eCommerce retailers can receive orders through myriad channels. In 2023, customers are expecting a seamless shopping experience across all channels.</p>
<p>The thing is, managing those orders from multiple channels can be a challenge.</p>
<p>So, it’s vital that you select a 3PL partner that has a demonstrated track record in managing fulfilment through multiple channels (this is typically called ‘omnichannel fulfilment’).</p>
<p>The very best <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/integrations/">third-party logistics providers</a> have the technology and associated dashboards that allow them to integrate directly with your multiple sales channels &#8211; whether they are Shopify, eBay, Amazon, Magento, or a broad mix of all of them!</p>
<p>If a 3PL can’t demonstrate this ability to integrate into your channels, give them a miss!</p>
<h3>Geographical network</h3>
<p>Another important point to consider when choosing a 3PL partner is whether they have an international network of warehouses and distribution points.</p>
<p>All too often, 3PLs will state that they have an international network, when the reality is they simply outsource these operations themselves.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/locations/">we have our own international warehouse and distribution locations</a> in the UK, the USA, China, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>With dedicated in-country warehousing, a 3PL will be able to keep your products stocked locally, making it quicker and easier to make and fulfil sales in those locations. Having international warehouse locations will also reduce your overall shipping costs and shipping times &#8211; meaning you can truly accelerate your growth in global markets.</p>
<h3>Customer service</h3>
<p>Don’t run the risk of just becoming a number! When selecting a 3PL partner for your fulfilment, you should select one that puts customer service at the top of their priorities.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, outsourcing your fulfilment is a big move. You’re handing control of your stock and fulfilment to a third party, after all. So, you want to choose a 3PL that’s going to be responsive and helpful to your queries.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, we provide a personal touch with every client being assigned their own account manager. This account manager acts as your point of contact and ensures that any queries you have are quickly answered.</p>
<p>This isn’t the case with other 3PLs, where you won’t receive a personalised, personal service.</p>
<p>What’s more, here at 3PL we also provide our customers with our <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">Fusion portal</a>, which provides them with on-demand access to their information 24/7 from anywhere in the world. At a glance, our customers can see the state of their inventory, orders and more.</p>
<p>It’s for these reasons that many of the fastest-growing eCommerce brands are <u>selecting</u><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/case-studies/"> 3PL</a> for their fulfilment.</p>
<h3>Specialised fulfilment services</h3>
<p>Whilst it may be tempting to think of fulfilment as a generic service, it really isn’t. So, when you’re selecting a third-party logistics provider, we suggest selecting one that truly understands eCommerce.</p>
<p>That’s because eCommerce &#8211; like other forms of retail &#8211; has nuances and details that can impact the fulfilment process in various ways.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, we understand eCommerce and know that certain products have specialist fulfilment requirements. That’s why we offer niche, specialist fulfilment for products such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/supplement-vitamin-fulfilment-services/">Supplement and vitamin fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/beauty-cosmetics-fulfilment-services/">Beauty and cosmetics fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fashion-fulfilment-services/">Fashion fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/electronics-fulfilment/">Electronics fulfilment</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t choose a generic 3PL. Choose one that understands your products and their specialist fulfilment requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many eCommerce brands, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are their biggest sales days of the year. If that’s the case for your brand, then keep reading. The 3PL team is about to tell you the things you need to know to make 2022’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday your best ones yet!</p>
<h2>When are Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2022?</h2>
<p>First, and most importantly, you’re going to want to make sure you don’t accidentally miss these crucial sales days… So, when exactly are they?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black Friday this year is on Friday 25th November</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber Monday this year is on Monday 28th November</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add these dates to your calendar now, and make sure that your team is aware of them. Ask your team to schedule rotas and annual leave accordingly so that you have sufficient people on hand to deal with a surge in sales.</p>
<h2>The ultimate Black Friday and Cyber Monday eCommerce checklist</h2>
<p>Okay, now that we’ve nailed down the dates of these two important sales events, we’ll take you through a checklist of all the things you should be doing ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
<h3>Prepare your online store for increased traffic</h3>
<p>If you’re expecting a particularly high volume of sales across Black Friday and Cyber Monday, then you need to make sure your website is able to handle it.</p>
<p>Make sure that you’re using a platform that’s able to maintain 99%+ uptime, and which also has the server capacity to handle large surges in visitors.</p>
<p>What you certainly don’t want to happen is for your website to crash, resulting in lost sales.</p>
<h3>Optimise your site for mobile</h3>
<p>Talk about Black Friday and Cyber Monday with many people, and they’ll think of people sitting at desktop PCs browsing the web.</p>
<p>Whilst this used to be the case, things are changing.</p>
<p>According to research conducted by DataReportal, a staggering 79% of smartphone users say they use their phones to make purchases through apps or websites.</p>
<p>So, you need to make sure that your website is optimised to create a truly intuitive, easy-to-use mobile experience.</p>
<p>Fail to do this, and you’ll lose customers to eCommerce brands that do.</p>
<h3>Check your checkout process</h3>
<p>It’s all very well preparing your website for large numbers of visitors, and ensuring mobile visitors have a good experience if they struggle to check out.</p>
<p>At least a few weeks before Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you want to thoroughly test the checkout process on your website. Try placing test orders and look for errors regarding shipping, tax or other errors.</p>
<p>You should also pay particularly close attention to the payment processing part of the checkout experience. Test how easy it is to add cards, remove cards, and update billing addresses/delivery addresses etc.</p>
<p>Research from Drip has found that the abandoned cart rate across all eCommerce sites is an alarmingly high 69.57%. So, any improvement you can make to your website’s checkout process is likely to lead to fewer abandoned carts and thus increased sales.</p>
<h3>Use retargeting to bring old users back to your website</h3>
<p>If you’re able to reach people who have previously been exposed to your brand, you stand a far better chance of turning them into paying customers.</p>
<p>But, how can you do this?</p>
<p>By using retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p>Good quality retargeting campaigns use the cookies which your website drops into the browsers of your visitors. This cookie is then used to show adverts from your brand on other websites that the visitor goes to.</p>
<p>They are effectively ‘chased’ around the web by your adverts. According to research conducted by Outgrow, retargeting campaigns can result in a 1 to 5% increase in sales.</p>
<h3>Ensure your customer service team is ready</h3>
<p>Dealing with a large surge in customer enquiries is never easy. That’s particularly the case during Black Friday and Cyber Monday when your customer service team could potentially be overwhelmed with enquiries.</p>
<p>If having looked at previous years’ sales data, you think you’ll be receiving a particularly large surge in sales during these days, then consider scaling up your customer service team with temporary hires.</p>
<p>The key to getting this right, however, is to ensure that the temps are fully trained and integrated with your existing team.</p>
<p>Customers don’t want to speak to people who aren’t able to provide them with answers quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>Communicate in a clear, transparent, honest way</h3>
<p>Related to the point above about customer service, it’s essential that you communicate with customers in a clear, transparent and honest way.</p>
<p>If a customer’s order is going to be delayed, then tell them that. Don’t try to avoid it.</p>
<p>This is especially important in 2022, as Google has introduced new algorithm changes centred around customer reviews.</p>
<p>If you fail to communicate honestly, which results in negative Google reviews (and reviews on other sites such as Trustpilot), the organic performance of your website is likely to suffer as Google prioritises similar businesses with better reviews.</p>
<h3>Get your fulfilment up to speed!</h3>
<p>One of the most overlooked &#8211; yet crucially important parts of preparing your eCommerce brand for Black Friday and Cyber Monday &#8211; is fulfilment.</p>
<p>Fulfilment refers to everything that takes place from the moment a customer places an order on your website, to the moment they receive said order in their hands.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably gathered, that encompasses a huge range of processes, from inventory and warehouse management to order processing, picking and packing, and delivery.</p>
<p>Unless you have a large, highly-experienced in-house fulfilment team, managing all of these processes during the busiest trading days of the year can be an almost impossible endeavour.</p>
<p>So, what’s the solution?</p>
<p>Consider outsourcing your fulfilment to a specialist third-party provider. These companies are known as 3PLs, and they do nothing else but carry out fulfilment for other brands.</p>
<p>Because they do nothing else but fulfilment, they are experts at it. Not only that, but because they take care of fulfilment for multiple brands, they are able to benefit from economies of scale and unbeatable shipping rates &#8211; passing the savings on to their customers, like you.</p>

		<p>The peak season is rapidly approaching for many eCommerce stores. With it, comes a surge in returns. Whether you like it or not, it’s more important than ever that you offer your customers an easy, seamless returns process &#8211; otherwise, you’ll lose them to a brand that does.<strong><em> So, keep reading, and the 3PL team will tell you how to optimise your reverse logistics process…</em></strong></p>
<h2>What is reverse logistics?</h2>
<p>If you’re relatively new to the world of logistics, then you may not be familiar with the term ‘reverse logistics’.</p>
<p>Reverse logistics essentially refers to the process of moving goods from customers back to the retailers from which they have bought them.</p>
<p>In other words &#8211; reverse logistics simply refers to the process of handling and processing returns.</p>
<p>The reverse logistics process usually follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The customer decides to initiate a return &#8211; usually via an online portal, email, or phone call to the original retailer.</li>
<li>If the retailer agrees to the return of the item &#8211; this can take multiple forms, from the customer arranging postage and packaging themselves, the retailer arranging postage and packaging, or the use of drop-off points, return lockers, or brick and mortar locations.</li>
<li>The return is processed and assessed by the retailer.</li>
<li>The goods are then either recycled/disposed of, or returned to the retailer’s inventory for sale once again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why does reverse logistics matter?</h2>
<p>We’re not resorting to hyperbole when we say that reverse logistics <em>is more important than ever</em>.</p>
<p>Today, consumers expect to be able to return their purchases in a way which is hassle-free, easy, and at no expense to themselves.</p>
<p>Not only that, but consumers are returning purchases more frequently. According to research conducted by Shopify, around a quarter of all online shoppers return 5% and 15% of the items they buy.</p>
<p>But, not all retail segments face the same level of returns. Below, we’ve listed the retail that segments that have the highest levels of returns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apparel (e.g. clothing and accessories) &#8211; 12.2%.</li>
<li>Housewares &#8211; 11.5%.</li>
<li>Footwear &#8211; 9.1%.</li>
<li>Beauty &#8211; 4.3%.</li>
<li>Hard goods (e.g. appliances) &#8211; 3.8%.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only are consumers returning their purchases at a higher rate, but they are expecting retailers to be far more lenient and accepting of returns than in years past.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% of consumers want a hassle-free ‘no questions asked’ returns policy from the brands they shop with.</li>
<li>79% of consumers expect free shipping on returns.</li>
<li>67% of shoppers check the returns page of an online store before committing to a purchase.</li>
<li>47% of consumers want an easy-to-print return label.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst these stats may seem daunting, they offer a major opportunity for eCommerce stores that take reverse logistics seriously.</p>
<h2>How to optimise your returns and reverse logistics process</h2>
<p>If you want to stand out in the crowded world of eCommerce &#8211; particularly during peak season &#8211; then optimising your returns process is a sure-fire way of achieving this.</p>
<p>Below, the 3PL team has set out their top seven tips to ensure that your reverse logistics process is as customer friendly as possible.</p>
<h3>1. Figure out why returns happen</h3>
<p>What if you could prevent returns from happening in the first place? Both you, and your customers, would be happier!</p>
<p>According to research by Shopify, the top reason for returns is that items don’t fit as expected. Another major reason is that the ordered items aren’t as described.</p>
<p>If you can figure out the main reasons why your brand receives returns, you can take actions to remedy the root issue and reduce the number of returns occurring in future.</p>
<p>The easiest way to gather this information is to ask the reason for return during the returns process. So, when a customer initiates a return &#8211; be it via your online portal, by email, or by phone &#8211; remember to always ask <em>why </em>they are returning the item.</p>
<p>You’ll gather valuable insights that will not only reduce the volume of returns you have to process &#8211; but your customers will be happier, too. They’ll be getting the item they want and expect, first time!</p>
<h3>2. Have a clear returns policy</h3>
<p>Miscommunication is at the root of many bad customer service experiences.</p>
<p>So, make sure you have a crystal clear returns policy.</p>
<p>Set out your returns policy in simple, easy-to-understand language (ditch the legalese!).</p>
<p>With many consumers checking return policies before making a purchase, having a clear returns policy will not only reduce the number of returns you receive, but will actually help you sell more items in the first place!</p>
<p>In addition to setting out your returns policy in simple language, you should also set out your returns process. That way, customers won’t have any nasty surprises when it comes to making a return. They’ll know the process that you follow to complete a return.</p>
<h3>3. Provide return labels</h3>
<p>If you operate in a retail segment that has particularly high rates of returns such as clothing, you can save you and your customer time, stress, and money, by providing a pre-printed return label with every label.</p>
<p>Sure, you will incur a slightly higher cost as a result of doing this, but you’ll make the returns experience incredibly convenient for your customers. What’s more, you’ll make your in-house returns process more efficient, as you’ll be able to process and re-inventory items much more quickly.</p>
<h3>4. Use reusable packaging</h3>
<p>In a similar vein to providing return labels, you should consider packing your orders in robust, reusable packaging.</p>
<p>If you want to make your returns process as convenient as possible for your customers, then using reusable packaging will make their lives as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Why? Because, when it’s time for them to make a return, they can simply use the existing packaging and won’t have to go out and buy a new box/package.</p>
<h3>5. Communicate, communicate, communicate</h3>
<p>When many people make a return, they’re keen to make an alternative purchase (for example, they’ll want to buy an alternative item of clothing that’s of the correct size).</p>
<p>As such, you can optimise your reverse logistics process by providing plenty of communication during every stage of a return.</p>
<p>If you are able to inform customers about the status of their return &#8211; and when they’ll receive a refund &#8211; they are much more likely to shop with you again in the future.</p>
<h3>6. Optimise your returns processing</h3>
<p>The faster you can process returns, the quicker you can get those items back into your inventory and recoup the cost of the refund.</p>
<p>Make sure that your returns processing team is fully-trained and able to identify items which can be passed back into inventory, and those items that need to be recycled or disposed of.</p>
<h3>7. Outsource your returns process</h3>
<p>The most effective way to optimise your reverse logistics is to outsource it!</p>
<p>Think of it this way &#8211; you’re an expert when it comes to your products &#8211; but are you a logistics expert?!</p>
<p>We thought not!</p>
<p>Just as you source professionals to carry out jobs on your plumbing and electrics, it makes sense to source logistics professionals to take care of your reverse logistics on your behalf.</p>
<p>These reverse logistics professionals (called 3PLs, or third-party logistics providers), specialise in processing returns, and as such, have highly efficient and cost-effective processes for doing so.</p>
<p>Why not let them process your returns in the most efficient way possible?</p>
<h2>Outsource your reverse logistics to 3PL today</h2>

		<p>If you feel like competition for new customers is fiercer than ever, you’d be right. That means you can’t simply provide an excellent product. You’ve got to provide an amazing post-purchase experience to your customers too. Keep on reading, and 3PL will tell you how to do exactly that!</p>
<h2>Why does the post-purchase experience matter?</h2>
<p>Surely it’s enough to provide an incredible product at the best possible price?!</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Whilst that would have been sufficient to win and retain customers in the past, consumer expectations have changed.</p>
<p>Today, consumers expect exceptional levels of communication, easy returns processes, personalisation, rewards for being loyal and more.</p>
<p>In other words, consumers don’t simply want to be abandoned once they’ve made a purchase from you.</p>
<h3>The value of customer retention</h3>
<p>Is it really worth going above and beyond once a customer has made a purchase from you?</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>By creating a fantastic post-purchase customer experience, you’ll greatly enhance the likelihood of retaining that customer and securing further purchases from them in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, to drive home how important a good post-purchase experience, and by extension, customer retention is, let’s take a look at some facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing retention rates by as little as 5% could increase your profits by as much as 25%.</li>
<li>The probability of selling to an existing customer is 14% higher compared to the probability of selling to a new customer.</li>
<li>Almost 40% of consumers have said they would stop shopping with a brand entirely if they had a bad post-purchase experience with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not just about retention, either. Consider this; 77% of customers are willing to recommend a brand to a friend. So, a great post-purchase experience can help you <strong><em>win new customers</em></strong> as well as retain existing ones.</p>
<p>What’s more, a study conducted earlier this year by eCommerce software company Metapack found that an unbelievable 93% of consumers have had a bad post-purchase experience during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>This provides an incredible opportunity for brands that <em>do</em> focus on creating a great post-purchase experience for their customers.</p>
<h2>How to improve your post-purchase customer experience</h2>
<p>Okay, so we’ve highlighted how important improving your post-purchase customer experience is. But, how do you go about doing this? The 3PL team has provided their top tips below.</p>
<h3>Say thank you</h3>
<p>This may seem like a blindingly obvious point &#8211; but, that’s perhaps why it is so often overlooked.</p>
<p>Simply say thank you!</p>
<p>Whether it takes the form of an order confirmation email or a card placed in with the order itself, saying thank you makes a big difference! It shows you’re not taking the customer for granted.</p>
<h3>Personalise!</h3>
<p>Nobody likes being referred to as a number. So, be sure to personalise your communications and post-purchase marketing efforts.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as using the customer’s name in communications, to providing personalised product recommendations in future marketing emails. By using a customer’s name, you’ll be forging a more personal connection and building loyalty.</p>
<h3>Reward loyalty</h3>
<p>Talking of loyalty, if you’re serious about creating a great post-purchase experience and retaining customers, then you should reward their loyalty!</p>
<p>Whether it’s a discount code for their next purchase, VIP access to a discounted sales event, or exclusive first access to sought-after products, you’re far more likely to retain customers if you offer them rewards for their loyalty.</p>
<h3>Surprise your customers with treats!</h3>
<p>Related closely to the above point about rewarding loyalty, you should also consider surprising returning customers with treats!</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to offer a free gift at checkout. This makes the shopping experience far more rewarding and fulfilling and is a tactic which is being successfully deployed by brands such as Getir.</p>
<h3>Satisfaction surveys</h3>
<p>Consumers like to have their voices heard. So, allow them to fill out a satisfaction survey following their purchase.</p>
<p>Not only will this show that you value the customer’s opinion, but it’s a fantastic way of securing valuable feedback and insights that’ll allow you to improve your post-purchase experience.</p>
<h3>Provide easy access to customer service</h3>
<p>If something does go wrong &#8211; perhaps the item has arrived damaged, or not arrived at all &#8211; it’s important that your customers are able to speak to you quickly and easily.</p>
<p>They don’t want to spend ages clicking through your website and not finding any help. They don’t want to send an email and have to wait a week for a reply. They want it sorted now!</p>
<p>So, provide quick and easy access to real human beings who can fix your customers’ problems. And, if you think that contact centres are too expensive for your brand, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/outsourced-contact-centre-services/">then think again</a>.</p>
<h3>Provide how-to guides</h3>
<p>If you sell products which require assembly or take a bit of getting used to regarding their operation, then you can massively improve the post-purchase experience by providing how-to guides.</p>
<p>Providing simple, easy-to-understand guides can help your customers better enjoy their purchases, as well as reducing the number of returns you receive from frustrated customers.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways you can provide these how-to guides, from written blogs through to video tutorials or infographics.</p>
<h3>Flexible delivery options</h3>
<p>Everybody leads busy lives these days. So, one of the biggest things you can do to improve your customers’ post-purchase experience is to provide personalised delivery options.</p>
<p>Whether a customer wants to collect their order from a delivery locker, have it delivered to their home on a specific date, or pick up their order from a brick-and-mortar location, you should be providing them with as many delivery options as possible.</p>
<h3>Be clear about returns</h3>
<p>Make your returns policy clear, easy to understand, and visible on your website. This not only reduces customer anxiety concerning returns, but it also shows that you’re transparent and not just focused on making as many sales as possible.</p>
<p>Given that, according to a survey conducted by Shopify, ‘a quarter of all consumers return between 5% and 15% of the items they buy online’, it’s important to be clear about the scenarios in which you will, and won’t, allow returns.</p>

		<p>The peak selling season for many eCommerce stores is rapidly approaching. And, with it, the busiest time of year for returns too. If you want to be better prepared to deal with these returns &#8211; and reduce your costs associated with them &#8211; then keep reading.</p>
<h2>Why peak season returns are important</h2>
<p>With leading bank Citi predicting that UK inflation rates could hit 18% by early 2023, it’s more important than ever that you not only handle returns correctly but that you do so in a way that saves you money.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrectly handling returns during peak season could have a significant impact on your eCommerce store’s profitability.</strong></p>
<p>Not only can a clear, transparent returns process save you money, but it can also improve customer loyalty &#8211; something which is going to be crucial should the economy take a further turn for the worst.</p>
<h2>How to reduce the costs of your peak season returns</h2>
<p>With those points in mind, let’s look at some ways in which you can reduce the costs associated with your peak season returns.</p>
<h3>Avoid returns altogether</h3>
<p>This isn’t necessarily going to be suitable for all types of eCommerce stores, however some retailers are now opting to avoid returns altogether &#8211; instead, allowing customers to keep the item in question.</p>
<p>This is a strategy which mainly lends itself to retailers who sell lower-value items or fast moving consumer goods. In these scenarios, the cost of the return can be higher than the value of the item itself.</p>
<p>Not only does this remove the need to deal with returns altogether, but it can also help build customer loyalty.</p>
<h3>Encourage in-store drop offs</h3>
<p>If you have brick and mortar locations in addition to your online store, then one of the most effective ways you can reduce the costs associated with peak season returns is to encourage in-store drop offs.</p>
<p>Not only does this BORIS (Buy Online Return In Store) returns strategy reduce costs associated with logistics and shipping, but in fact many customers actually prefer to return their items to a physical location.</p>
<p>According to a study by shipping provider UPS, 45% of Europeans prefer to return items in person to a brick and mortar store.</p>
<h3>Use pre-printed return labels</h3>
<p>With around 30% of purchases made during the peak season being returned, it makes sense to plan ahead and include pre-printed return labels within order packages.</p>
<p>Not only does this make the returns process far easier for the customer &#8211; thus encouraging customer loyalty &#8211; but it can help you to reduce costs by pre-selecting the most cost-efficient shipping service based on the customer’s location.</p>
<p>Using pre-printed returns labels can also speed things up once the package arrives back at your warehouse. By adding relevant information to the return label, you and your team will be able to more efficiently process the return back into your inventory.</p>
<h3>Deliver parcels on time</h3>
<p>This may seem like a no brainer, but when it comes to the peak season, people are almost always buying presents for a particular date.</p>
<p>If your shipping provider is unable to deliver parcels ahead of those dates, then you’re going to experience a flurry of returns &#8211; and their associated costs.</p>
<p>After all, who needs Christmas presents after Christmas?!</p>
<p>You can preempt any delivery issues by using shipping providers that use tracking software, meaning you can spot the early warning signs of delivery issues. Based on those tracking updates, you and your customer service team can communicate with customers and try and resolve any delays.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps the customer would be willing to collect their parcel from a storage locker instead? Or the product could be sent from a different distribution centre in order to arrive on time.</p>
<h3>Optimise your packaging</h3>
<p>The peak selling season sees a truly vast number of parcels and packages being handled by shipping providers.</p>
<p>This means that during peak periods, your packages are potentially going to be spending more time in transit, going through more stops along the way, more handling by busy delivery drivers and more moving and sorting in general.</p>
<p>As a result, the chances of damage to packages is much higher during the peak period.</p>
<p>Naturally, damaged packages are not only going to be viewed poorly by customers who receive them, but they’re much more likely to result in returns &#8211; and with that, higher costs for you.</p>
<p>You can reduce these costs and returns by ensuring that packages sent out during the peak period are fit for purpose. For example, if you’re experiencing a level of damage-related returns for products which are shipped in padded envelopes, it may make sense to send these items in boxes instead.</p>
<p>Whilst optimising your packaging in this way may lead to some increased costs for packaging materials, these costs are going to pale in comparison to dealing with returns and damaged products.</p>
<h3>Lengthen your returns timeframe</h3>
<p>One way in which you can reduce the costs associated with peak season returns is to make sure these returns aren’t made during the peak season!</p>
<p>Let us explain…</p>
<p>By extending the amount of time that customers have to make returns during the peak season, you can reduce the burden on your returns processing team.</p>
<p>You’ll effectively be spreading out your returns into the quieter post-peak period.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, if you stuck to your standard returns period, you’d find you have a huge number of returns to deal with during an already busy period. In many instances, you may have to take on additional temporary staff to deal with these returns.</p>
<p>Lengthening your returns timeframe eliminates the need to scale up manpower, thereby saving you money.</p>
<h3>Outsource your returns handling</h3>
<p>If you want to truly unlock savings regarding your returns, then it can make sense to outsource your returns handling.</p>
<p>Third-party logistics companies are focused on handling returns in the most efficient way &#8211; meaning they can reduce the cost of your returns significantly.</p>
<p>Specialists like <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/">3PL</a> are adept at handling returns for multiple major eCommerce brands and because they deal with returns at high volumes, they benefit from economies of scale &#8211; which are passed on to you.</p>

		<p>As an eCommerce store, one of the worst things that can happen is running out of stock. Not only will you lose sales, but running out of stock can damage your reputation, SEO and more. If you want to ensure this never happens to you, read 3PL’s guide to managing your stock levels effectively now…</p>
<h2>Why is it important to manage your stock levels?</h2>
<p>Aside from the reasons outlined above, there are numerous reasons that effective stock or inventory management is important.</p>
<p>Not only will effective inventory management ensure you always maintain stock of popular and fast-selling products, but it can also prevent you from having <em>too many </em>items in stock, thus incurring storage costs.</p>
<p>Having too much inventory can also mean that you have more capital tied up than you can afford, which can result in inventory becoming outdated and unsellable and more. It can also result in you requiring more warehouse space than you need; again, reducing the profitability of your operations.</p>
<p>So, whether it’s saving you from having too much or too little stock, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/what-is-inventory-control-a-guide-for-ecommerce-retailers/">effective inventory management is important</a>.</p>
<h2>How to determine the optimum stock levels for your eCommerce business</h2>
<p>Okay, so we’ve seen how important good management of stock levels is. But, how do you go about actually doing it? What does optimum stock or inventory management look like?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number of ways of determining the optimum stock levels for eCommerce stores that we’ve detailed below.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand production lead times</strong></h3>
<p>By understanding production lead times you can make better decisions regarding when items of inventory need to be re-ordered.</p>
<p>For example, if you know that some of your items of inventory take several weeks to be produced, then you’ll be able to factor this into your inventory reordering schedule.</p>
<p>In addition to the amount of time it takes for your items of inventory to be produced, you should also consider related factors such as the amount of time it takes for those items to be shipped from the factory to your warehouse, any shutdowns that the factory may make (e.g. for holidays) and how it long it takes for you to process and store new items of inventory.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety stock</strong></h3>
<p>Safety stock refers to additional inventory that you set aside for unexpected circumstances. It effectively acts as a reserve in case you receive a sudden surge in orders, or experience a significant delay in receiving new inventory.</p>
<p>So, it can be helpful to ensure you always have some safety stock in your inventory &#8211; the trick is to ensure you have the <em>right amount </em>of safety stock.</p>
<p>To calculate the right volume of safety stock to keep in your inventory you should take into account the maximum daily sales of an item, its maximum lead time, its average daily sales, and the average lead time in receiving new stock.</p>
<h3><strong>Use demand forecasting</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most important things you can do to ensure you maintain optimum stock levels is to use demand forecasting.</p>
<p>Demand forecasting allows you to look ahead and anticipate which particular items within your inventory are going to be popular, which items may be slow sellers and more. From there, you can make better decisions regarding your inventory management.</p>
<p>There are a number of different types of demand forecasting which can be useful for eCommerce retailers including economy-based forecasting and time-based forecasting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guide &#8211; to find out more, </em></strong><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/demand-forecasting/"><strong><em>read our guide to demand forecasting</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<h2>The best techniques for managing your eCommerce stock levels effectively</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve examined how you can determine what your optimum stock levels should be, let’s take a look at some best practices that’ll help you manage your eCommerce inventory in general</p>
<h3><strong>Audit your inventory regularly</strong></h3>
<p>If you don’t actually know what items you’ve got in your inventory, then it can be impossible to manage your stock at optimum levels.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways in which you can audit your stock levels, but one of the simplest ways to do so is rolling stock takes, where stock takes are carried out on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Whilst they do involve more work than traditional year-end stock takes, they do provide you with up-to-date visibility of your inventory and any associated issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Create a contingency plan</strong></h3>
<p>How would you cope if one of your key suppliers went out of business? What if the production quality of your items suddenly dropped drastically? What would you do if material shortages in a particular location meant you had to change your supplier at short notice?</p>
<p>The answers to all of these questions and more should be included in a contingency plan.</p>
<p>By creating a contingency plan you’ll be better able to deal with any major issues and find alternative solutions quickly. After all, failure to have a contingency plan in place can throw your inventory management efforts into chaos…</p>
<h3><strong>Build solid relationships with suppliers</strong></h3>
<p>Related to the above point, you should try and build solid relationships with your suppliers.</p>
<p>Doing so will not only mean you’ll be given advance notice of any potential supply issues, but you&#8217;ll be able to work collaboratively with them on things like product improvement, product innovation, and more.</p>
<p>Aside from avoiding problems, building close relationships with suppliers can also bring benefits. For example, if you’re a long-term valued customer you may be able to access volume buying discounts, be the first to access new products and be able to set up better creditor terms.</p>
<h3><strong>Use an inventory management system</strong></h3>
<p>With the right type of inventory management software, it’s possible to gain a highly-accurate view of your current inventory, as well as automating many tasks (such as product reorder points) to not improve not only improve the accuracy of your stock management, but make it more efficient too.</p>
<h3><strong>Outsource your inventory management</strong></h3>
<p>If you really want to make the management of your stock levels as efficient and effective as possible, then it can be a good idea to outsource it to a specialist.</p>
<p>Companies such as 3PL can manage your inventory on your behalf, providing you with a <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">digital dashboard</a> with real-time visibility of your inventory.</p>
<p>Not only can outsourcing your inventory management to a third-party be more efficient, but it can also allow you to cut or reduce costs on things like warehousing space and inventory staff.</p>

		<p>Regardless of what your eCommerce store sells, it’s likely that you have a peak season; a time of the year when you make the bulk of your sales. So, it’s vital that you’re as prepared as possible for this period. The 3PL team has provided their top 10 tips to help you do just that, and be as prepared as possible for your peak season, below…</p>
<h2>What is peak season planning?</h2>
<p>Before we delve into our top 10 tips, let’s define exactly what we mean by the term ‘peak season planning’.</p>
<p>Peak season planning refers to the process of gearing up your eCommerce store’s operations in readiness for your busiest sales period(s) of the year.</p>
<p>It usually involves a deep dive into your current operations, looking in detail at everything from the technical health of your website through to the speed, efficiency and accuracy of your fulfilment operations.</p>
<p>The core aim of peak season planning is to identify weaknesses in your operations &#8211; especially when order volumes and activity will increase &#8211; and set out actions to remedy them.</p>
<h2>When are the main peak seasons for eCommerce stores?</h2>
<p>Whilst peak seasons will vary depending on what eCommerce stores sell &#8211;  a store selling holiday clothing is going to have its peak in the summer, whilst a store selling eCards is going to have its peak at Christmas &#8211; there are some peak selling seasons that are common to the majority of eCommerce businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/how-to-get-your-ecommerce-store-ready-for-the-peak-selling-season/">As we’ve written previously</a>, these peak seasons for eCommerce stores can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Friday.</li>
<li>Cyber Monday.</li>
<li>Christmas Day.</li>
<li>Amazon Prime Day.</li>
<li>Region and country-specific peak dates such as Click Frenzy (Australia) and AliBaba Singles’ Day (China).</li>
</ul>
<h2>The top 10 tips to get your eCommerce store ready for your peak season</h2>
<p>Whilst you may be reading this many months before your peak sales season, it’s never too early to start preparing for peak. So, read the 10 tips below and start thinking about implementing them across your operations today!</p>
<h3><strong>1. Make use of historical data</strong></h3>
<p>If you’ve been running your eCommerce store for several years, then you’ll (hopefully) have a wealth of historical data at your disposal.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s not possible to entirely predict what your forthcoming peak season will look like exactly, but your historical data should help you to identify common trends.</p>
<p>For example, you should be able to identify product lines which are popular year after year. As a result, you can make sure you have sufficient stock of these items in your inventory in readiness for the peak season.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Ensure your website is responsive</strong></h3>
<p>By this, we mean that your website is able to effectively adapt to a range of different screen sizes &#8211; especially mobile.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when shoppers stuck to desktop PCs. In fact, today, according to one piece of recent research, 40% of all online peak season purchases are made via smartphone.</p>
<p>In other words, you really can’t afford for your website to function poorly on mobile &#8211; or else you could be missing out on a huge percentage of potential sales!</p>
<h3><strong>3. Invest in Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)</strong></h3>
<p>It’s all very well having a website that looks good on all kinds of devices, but if it’s difficult to use and the checkout process is slow and cumbersome, that’ll cost you sales too.</p>
<p>Because of this, we recommend that you invest in Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO). CRO is the practice of increasing the percentage of visitors to your website to take a desired action. In the case of eCommerce stores, this is placing an order.</p>
<p>A good CRO specialist will be able to identify the various snags and faults on your site which are causing people not to place an order. These snags can be anything from overly complicated checkout processes, to slow page loading times.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Gear up your marketing</strong></h3>
<p>You’re probably marketing your store all-year-round, but when it comes to the peak season, you really need to up your efforts.</p>
<p>Because there are so many retailers vying for the attention of online consumers during peak times, you need to make sure that you really stand out.</p>
<p>So, be sure to review your marketing strategy. Make sure that you’ve created detailed personas of your target customers. Think about which platforms and channels they use when they&#8217;re online. Consider keeping some budget aside so that you can spend more on targeted ads during your peak season.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Perfect your customer service</strong></h3>
<p>With so many eCommerce stores vying for business (it’s estimated that there are more than 12 million eCommerce stores across the globe), it’s essential that you have nailed your customer service operations.</p>
<p>If a customer isn’t happy with your service, it’s easier than ever for them to shop with a competitor instead.</p>
<p>So, ensure that your customer service, from handling pre-purchase queries to dealing with complaints, are absolutely on-point ahead of your peak season.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Ensure your inventory management system is up to scratch</strong></h3>
<p>Do you know what’s in your inventory at any one time? Do you have automatic reorder points set up for popular items? If you can’t say yes to those questions, then you need to review the way you manage your inventory.</p>
<p>One of the worst things that can happen during your peak season is running out of stock.</p>
<p>By using a good-quality inventory management system, you can avoid this issue.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Offer a personalised service</strong></h3>
<p>With up to 80% of shoppers saying that they’re more likely to make a purchase from an eCommerce store that offers personalised service, it’s important that you take this into account ahead of your peak season.</p>
<p>By making use of cookies, data from third-party platforms and customer data platforms, you can undertake marketing efforts such as personalised emails, personal product recommendations and cross-sells, and special offers tailored to an individual’s wants and/or needs.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Consider scaling up your team</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re expecting a particularly busy peak season, then it can help to hire additional members of staff (even if it’s only on a temporary basis) to ensure that important departments like customer service and fulfilment have sufficient capacity.</p>
<p>If you are going to do this though, ensure that temp staff are hired well in advance of your peak season and given detailed, in-depth training. This will ensure they are ready and fully-prepared to handle their roles and responsibilities during what is likely going to be a hectic and stressful period.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Consider offering fast, free shipping</strong></h3>
<p>More and more online shoppers are now expecting their orders to include free shipping. Thanks to the likes of Amazon and others, they’re also expecting their orders to arrive rapidly.</p>
<p>Whilst free shipping can entail additional costs, it can be possible to make it profitable by factoring it into the price of your goods, or by encouraging upsells and cross-sells (which can increase the margin you’re making on an individual order).</p>
<h3><strong>10. Outsource your fulfilment</strong></h3>
<p>Handling fulfilment in-house can be challenging even during relatively quiet periods. But, during peak season, tackling fulfilment can become an all-consuming task, often with people from other departments being drafted in to help pick and pack orders.</p>
<p>This is hardly an ideal scenario, and can lead to other, important, parts of your business operations suffering.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your fulfilment to a dedicated third-party logistics (3PL) company, you can rest assured that your fulfilment is being handled by dedicated, experienced fulfilment professionals, leaving you and your team to concentrate on your core business operations.</p>

		<p>Shipping costs are on the rise. Whether you’re securing supplies from overseas, or sending out orders to customers, you’ve no doubt noticed that your shipping bill is getting higher and higher. That’s why you should keep reading, as the 3PL team tells you everything you need to know about nailing your shipping basics and keeping costs in check…</p>
<h2><strong>Why are shipping costs rising?</strong></h2>
<p>As an owner of an eCommerce store or other type of business, you’re undoubtedly watching the continually rising cost of shipping with concern.</p>
<p>But, <em>why </em>is the cost of shipping rising so much at the moment?</p>
<p>As with any issue that spans the globe, there are multiple reasons, but speak to any logistics expert and they’ll usually say it’s mainly down to the following factors.</p>
<h3><strong>Shipping container shortage</strong></h3>
<p>As the Covid-19 lockdowns came into effect, demand for containers collapsed. This resulted in manufacturers of containers significantly dialling down production.</p>
<p>Since demand has recovered, container manufacturers have struggled to catch up, meaning that any available container has an exceptional surcharge attached to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Increased consumer demand</strong></h3>
<p>During the Covid-19 lockdowns we saw a massive increase in consumer demand for everything from furniture to clothing.</p>
<p>This huge increase in consumer demand meant that higher volumes of goods were being shipped. This huge consumer demand was not matched with a higher supply of vessels etc. As a result, shipping costs increased.</p>
<h3><strong>Oil price rises</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the collapse in demand for oil during the Covid-19 lockdowns (resulting in the cancellation of many new oil and gas projects), and the war in Ukraine, oil prices have skyrocketed and are now consistently over $100 a barrel.</p>
<p>The result of this is that couriers and shipping companies are facing more expensive fuel costs. They are increasingly passing on these rising fuel costs to customers in the form of higher shipping rates.</p>
<h2><strong>What are shipping costs?</strong></h2>
<p>Before we go any further, let’s just define exactly what we mean by the term ‘shipping costs’.</p>
<p>Shipping refers to the process of preparing and packing an order and then sending it to a customer. The means by which it reaches a customer will depend on the courier or shipping service that you choose, but common means of shipping include road transport (vans or lorries) or rail, and in the case of international shipping, container ships or aeroplanes.</p>
<p>Therefore shipping costs refer to any costs incurred throughout this process. This includes labour time, the cost of packaging, storage in inventory, and costs associated with transport and delivery.</p>
<p>If you’re using a courier to send your orders to customers, then you’ll usually be charged a single fee which covers transport and delivery, whilst the cost of packaging is covered by yourself.</p>
<h2><strong>How are shipping costs calculated?</strong></h2>
<p>With the above in mind, you might be wondering how shipping costs are calculated. Is it simply based on the inputs involved?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. Different shipping companies calculate shipping costs in different ways, however they generally involve one (or more) of the following variables.</p>
<h3><strong>Package weight</strong></h3>
<p>This is one of the biggest factors that influences shipping cost. As you would expect, the heavier an item, the more it’s going to cost to ship.</p>
<p>Some shipping companies and couriers will use a pricing technique called dimensional weight (also called DIM weight). This not only takes into account an item’s weight, but it’s dimensions too.</p>
<h3><strong>Package dimensions</strong></h3>
<p>So, what exactly is dimensional weight? This involves a shipping company calculating both the dimensions (the size and shape of a package) as well as its weight.</p>
<p>It’s calculated by multiplying the height, length and width of a package and then dividing it by a standard DIM divisor (this is a figure which represents cubic inches per pound). Different shipping companies use different DIM divisors.</p>
<p>Be aware that many shipping companies, like USPS, FedEx and UPS calculate their shipping charges based on whatever is higher &#8211; the package’s weight, or its dimensional weight.</p>
<p>Whichever of these is the higher, becomes the ‘billable weight’ for your shipment.</p>
<h3><strong>Shipping destination</strong></h3>
<p>Destination matters. If you’re only sending a package to the next town over, then this is going to cost you a lot less than sending a package to another country.</p>
<p>Many shipping companies use what are called ‘shipping zones’ to calculate their shipping rates. These zones can range from Zone 1 to Zone 8 and are calculated on where your package is being shipped from.</p>
<p>As a result, if you end up shipping a package across multiple shipping zones, then you’re likely going to end up with a higher shipping bill.</p>
<h3><strong>Value of contents</strong></h3>
<p>If you need to send out high-value items to customers, this can result in the overall cost of your shipment going up as a result of needing to insure the package.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery speed</strong></h3>
<p>The faster you need to get a parcel to a customer, the more you’re going to pay in shipping rates.</p>
<p>If you decide to offer 1 or 2-day shipping to your customers, then you’re going to face higher shipping rates as the shipping company will have to use more elaborate, expensive ways of transporting your packages e.g. air freight.</p>
<h2><strong>How to reduce your shipping costs</strong></h2>
<p>As you can see, there are many variables that can affect the amount of money you pay for shipping. However, it’s not a lost cause! There are many things which you can do to reduce your overall shipping bill.</p>
<p>We’ve set out our top cost-saving tips below.</p>
<h3><strong>Weigh your packages</strong></h3>
<p>This seems like a no brainer, but you’d be surprised how many eCommerce companies miss this simple trick.</p>
<p>You should get your fulfilment team into the habit of weighing every package and making sure that it’s not absurdly heavy.</p>
<p>With shipping costs being as high as they are, it may actually cost you more to send very heavy items than what you actually make on them in profit!</p>
<p>If you find that you have very heavy items which don’t necessarily have huge profit margins, it may be better to sell them on a ‘customer collect’ basis, or allow customers to arrange their own delivery.</p>
<h3><strong>Check your packaging dimensions</strong></h3>
<p>As we’ve seen above, the dimensions of a package can play a big role in increasing the cost of shipping.</p>
<p>To save money, you should seek to rationalise your packaging dimensions. For example, are you sending everything out in the same size box? It may cost more to stock different size boxes, but in the long run you’ll save handsomely on shipping rates.</p>
<p>In addition to using boxes which are of a suitable size for each item, you should see if you can use custom packaging where possible. This will allow you to pack items as snugly as possible, with no wasted space which needs to be filled with packing material.</p>
<h3><strong>Use SIOC packaging</strong></h3>
<p>Another packaging-based trick you can try, is to use SIOC packaging.</p>
<p>SIOC (ships in own container) packaging isn’t necessarily suitable for all products, but can be a handy way of reducing the bulk of your package, as you are applying the shipping label directly to the product box.</p>
<p>Obviously, this means that the product box has to be robust enough to withstand the rigours of shipping.</p>
<p>So, if you have products which are in good quality boxes, it can make sense to ship them ‘as is’ rather than placing them in another box just to ship.</p>
<h3><strong>Purchase packaging in bulk</strong></h3>
<p>Whether it’s boxes or packing materials, you can save money by buying these items in bulk.</p>
<p>If you know that you’re going to have a consistent level of orders over the coming months, then you should be able to calculate the best bulk buying deal for your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Outsource your fulfilment</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best ways of reducing your shipping costs is to outsource your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider (known as a 3PL).</p>
<p>The reasoning is as follows &#8211; because a 3PL is handling shipping for multiple companies at once, they are able to negotiate much cheaper shipping rates. Because they will generally be sending hundreds (or even thousands) of packages every week, shipping companies will essentially provide them with a bulk discount.</p>
<p>In short &#8211; 3PLs can negotiate far cheaper shipping rates than you’ll be able to do on your own.</p>
