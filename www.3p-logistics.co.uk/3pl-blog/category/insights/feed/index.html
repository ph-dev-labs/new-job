										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Batch and serial number tracking is an essential part of the manufacturing process. This system helps ensure that control is maintained over the production process and that the quality of the products is maintained. In this article, we will look at what batch and serial number tracking is, the differences between batch and serial numbers, the importance of the right technology for batch control, and how 3PL batch and serial number tracking can help you take control of your stock. We will also look at the benefits of batch and serial number tracking and some tips for implementing it.</p>
<h2>What is Batch and Serial Number Tracking?</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking is a process used to identify and track products. This process helps to maintain control over the production process and can be used to ensure the quality of the products. It also helps to identify and trace any problems that may arise in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking involve assigning each product with a unique identifier. This unique identifier is used to track the product from production to sale. It also allows for the tracking of the product&#8217;s history, such as where it was produced, when it was produced, and who produced it. This information can be used to identify any potential problems with the product and to take corrective action.</p>
<h2>What is a Batch Number and how it works?</h2>
<p>A batch number is a unique identifier assigned to a group of products that were manufactured together. It is used to identify and track the products from production to sale. The batch number is typically printed on the product&#8217;s label or packaging.</p>
<p>The batch number can be used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. For example, if a product is found to be defective, the batch number can be used to trace the product back to the production line and determine the cause of the defect.</p>
<p><strong>Batch picking works in 4 steps:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Generate picking lists for each order</h3>
<p>A document called a picking list is used to convey information about the items that must be sent to a customer, such as SKU(s), quantities, and storage location(s) of the inventory.</p>
<p>When orders have the same picking lists, batch picking is the most effective method. This enables the picker to have a queue of orders ready for dispatch to various customers.</p>
<p>Printed lists are uncommon in today&#8217;s world. Instead, wearable devices and technology are utilised in modern warehouses to combine, allocate, and fulfil each order, eliminating the need for paper.</p>
<h3>2. Group orders by common items</h3>
<p>To perform batch picking, orders that have identical items must be combined into a batch. An order management system or a warehouse management system (WMS) can automatically group orders that are batchable and contain the same items and quantities.</p>
<h3>3. Give a batch to a picker</h3>
<p>A warehouse management system (WMS) can create batch pick lists for each picker, optimising the retrieval process of items. However, if done manually, it may be necessary to create an efficient route for each picker to retrieve all the SKUs.</p>
<h3>4. Pick all items in the order</h3>
<p>To avoid wasting time or taking unnecessary steps, each picker must adhere to the picking list and optimise their route to select the correct items. After picking the SKUs for the batch orders, the orders can be passed on to a packer, and the picker can proceed with the next batch.</p>
<h2>The advantages of batch picking</h2>
<h3>1. Less foot travel for employees</h3>
<p>Warehouses can be enormous, and traveling between each section of a warehouse can be time-consuming. If employees must retrieve items from multiple, distant locations, order fulfilment will take longer. Batch picking simplifies operations by allowing workers to complete the same task in bulk, reducing the distance they need to travel and increasing their productivity.</p>
<h3>2. Faster picking rates</h3>
<p>Efficient order fulfilment is a significant factor in the success of warehouse operations. Batch picking can help employees minimize their movement around the warehouse, allowing them to complete their tasks more quickly. By reducing travel time between orders, pickers can process orders more rapidly, decreasing the average time required to fulfil an order.</p>
<h3>3. Reduced costs</h3>
<p>As productivity rises, the amount of manpower required for picking decreases, resulting in minimal overtime and subsequently lowering the expenditure on labour costs.</p>
<h2>What is a Serial Number?</h2>
<p>A serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a single product. It is used to identify and track the product from production to sale. The serial number is typically printed on the product&#8217;s label or packaging.</p>
<p>The serial number can be used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. For example, if a product is found to be defective, the serial number can be used to trace the product back to the production line and determine the cause of the defect.</p>
<h2>What is the Difference between Batch and Serial Numbers?</h2>
<p>The main difference between batch and serial numbers is that batch numbers are assigned to a group of products that were manufactured together, while serial numbers are assigned to a single product. Batch numbers are typically used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. Serial numbers are typically used to identify and track individual products.</p>
<p>One example of a product that uses batch numbers is cosmetic products. Each batch of cosmetic products produced by a manufacturing company is given a unique batch number, which allows the product to be traced and identified in the event of a recall or quality issue. This helps ensure the safety and quality of the medication being distributed to consumers.</p>
<h2>The Importance of the Right Technology for Batch Control</h2>
<p>The right technology is essential for effective batch control. Technology such as RFID tags and barcode scanners can be used to track and identify products. This technology can help to ensure that the right products are being produced and that any problems are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, software technology can be used to automate the batch and serial number tracking process. This can help to reduce the amount of time and effort required to track and control batches of products. It can also help to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<h2>How Batch and Serial Number Tracking Can Help With Control</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can help to ensure that control is maintained over the production process. It can also help to identify and trace any problems that may arise in the manufacturing process. This can help to ensure that only the highest quality products are produced.</p>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can also help to improve the efficiency of the production process. Tracking the production process can help identify any areas that need improvement and ensure that the production process is running as smoothly as possible.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Batch and Serial Number Tracking</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can provide many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved control over the production process</li>
<li>Improved product quality</li>
<li>Reduced costs associated with product recalls</li>
<li>Improved efficiency of the production process</li>
<li>Improved traceability of products</li>
<li>Reduced time and effort required to track and control batches of products</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an award-winning ecommerce fulfilment specialist, we are often asked about the future of ecommerce. With our crystal ball in hand, our most recent blog post takes a predictive look into the future of the UK ecommerce sector for the remainder of 2023.</p>
<p>Here are our top 10 movers and shakers to be alive to:</p>
<p><strong>1. Overall UK ecommerce growth will slow down to pre-pandemic levels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A Year of Survival – particularly for aggregators and resellers with thin margins.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Cost reduction imperatives will drive sellers to invest in technology and business process often outsourcing physical operations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Amazon’s fees and advertising costs will continue to rise – leading many sellers to diversify their sales channels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Bitcoin and other forms of Crypto will start to emerge for online transactions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Growth in DTC e-commerce sites will continue to build momentum. The rising tide will float all DTC boats, but Shopify will be the primary beneficiary.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Liquidation sites will benefit from high inventories and slower ecommerce growth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Container shipping costs will drop as demand levels out and supply chain bottlenecks continue to be resolved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. eBay will do quite well with an increase in re-commerce and the rise in discount shopping.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. More ecommerce sellers and sites will embrace Artificial Intelligence.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to make 2023 the best year yet for your eCommerce business? Then you need to make sure you’re ahead of your competitors and actively embracing the top eCommerce trends. <strong>To find out what those trends are, keep reading…</strong></p>
<h2>1. Sustainability</h2>
<p>Barely a day goes by now without headlines about climate change, environmental destruction and eco-protests dominating the news.</p>
<p>Because of this, consumers are becoming more concerned about sustainability than ever before.</p>
<p>In fact, despite the emerging cost-of-living crisis, sustainability is still top of the agenda for consumers. According to a recent piece of research carried out by American Express, 65% of shoppers think about the environmental impact of the items they buy.</p>
<p>What’s more, 63% of respondents to that same survey said they will only shop with online retailers that offer sustainable, green, delivery options.</p>
<p>So, if your eCommerce business isn’t already taking sustainability seriously, it <em>NEEDS</em> to in 2023.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways in which you can green your eCommerce business. Actions you can take include switching to sustainable packaging, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/eco-friendly-order-fulfilment-services/">choosing an eco-friendly fulfilment provider</a>, switching to sustainable suppliers for your goods and services and more…</p>
<h2>2. Mobile shopping</h2>
<p>It’s not an exaggeration to say that the web <strong><em>is</em></strong> mobile now. For younger consumers in particular (think Gen Z), being ‘online’ no longer refers to being sat in front of a computer. In fact, many consumers now equate being online with their smartphone.</p>
<p>And, this doesn’t just apply to browsing. It applies to making purchases too.</p>
<p>According to market research agency Statista, mobile devices are responsible for 71% of retail traffic and 61% of online purchases.</p>
<p>Mobile is now <strong><em>that</em></strong> important to eCommerce retailers.</p>
<p>It’s vital then that your eCommerce store is optimised for mobile in 2023. This includes using a responsive design &#8211; so that your site looks great and is fully functional on any mobile device.</p>
<p>Fail to do this, and you’ll lose customers to those retailers who have truly embraced ‘m-commerce’ in 2023.</p>
<h2>3. Social retail</h2>
<p>Social retail is a trend which has been gaining popularity over the past year, but we predict that 2023 is the year it truly takes off.</p>
<p>Defined as ‘the use of social media platforms to sell products’, social retail has emerged thanks to platforms such as Instagram and TikTok allowing retailers to set up shopfronts directly on their platforms.</p>
<p>With shopfronts embedded natively on social platforms, eCommerce retailers are able to directly engage with their target audience and reduce the number of clicks consumers have to make in order to complete a purchase.</p>
<p>It’s a tactic which works particularly well for direct-to-consumer brands, and &#8211; at the time of writing &#8211; is responsible for something like 13% of all online sales (according to marketing software company SEMRush).</p>
<p>That’s an impressive number, and one that should inspire your brand to embrace and run with social retail in 2023.</p>
<h2>4. Personalisation</h2>
<p>Personalisation is a trend which has been floating around the eCommerce space for a couple of years &#8211; but we think the potentially challenging trading conditions of 2023 are what will see this trend truly embraced by online retailers.</p>
<p>Why? Because, according to the <em>State of Personalisation </em>report from Twilio Segment, 60% of consumers say they’ll become repeat consumers of a brand if they have received a personalised shopping experience.</p>
<p>When you consider that it costs less to retain a customer than acquire a new one, this is an important piece of information for eCommerce brands.</p>
<p>So, 2023 should be the year that you invest in personalising your marketing and sales efforts.</p>
<p>Whether it’s something as simple as personalised emails (which have a 6.2% higher open rate than regular emails by the way!), or going further and allowing people to customise their products (see: Nike), personalisation should be on your ‘to do’ list next year.</p>
<h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
<p>If you offer consumable goods (e.g. beauty products, razors, hygiene products), and you don’t already offer shoppers a subscription option &#8211; you need to do so in 2023.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over a quarter of weekly online shoppers have at least one subscription (as per research from Kearney).</li>
<li>One in 10 people are a member of a subscription service of some kind (via Shopblocks).</li>
<li>Demand for subscription gifts has <em>doubled </em>over the last four years (via Shopblocks).</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some powerful and eye-opening stats. If you want to drive revenue and customer retention in 2023, then subscriptions should certainly be part of the mix.</p>
<p>Offering subscriptions does have its own unique set of challenges, however, so it’s vital that things like your <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/subscription-box-fulfilment/">subscription fulfilment services</a> are geared up appropriately.</p>
<h2>6. Augmented reality</h2>
<p>With ever more people making purchases online, eCommerce merchandisers have been exploring new ways to display their products.</p>
<p>For retail verticals such as fashion, this is especially important, as it can be difficult for consumers to truly understand what a particular item is like from a static 2D image.</p>
<p>That’s why augmented reality is set to be one of the hot eCommerce trends to watch in 2023.</p>
<p>Expect to see the most forward-thinking retailers using demo videos and augmented reality to allow consumers to see products in 3D and visualise them in their own home, etc.</p>
<p>This isn’t merely technological vanity, either; <em>it actually works! </em>According to research from Google, shoppers engage with 3D and enhanced images of products 50% more than they do with static 2D ones.</p>
<p>If you want to boost your eCommerce website’s conversion rate in 2023, the answer is clear; invest in augmented reality!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer service (or rather lack of), can make or break eCommerce brands. Especially with review sites like Trustpilot being so prominent. So, if you want to provide the very best customer service without breaking the bank, it’s time to start thinking about using an outsourced contact centre service. <strong><em>Keep on reading to find out everything you need to know…</em></strong></p>
<h2>What is a contact centre?</h2>
<p>A contact centre is a centralised point where all interactions with customers are funnelled and dealt with.</p>
<p>Customers contact businesses in many ways, from telephone calls to emails &#8211; and it’s the job of contact centres to deal with these enquiries &#8211; regardless of the format they take.</p>
<p>Contact centres are typically divided into two distinct types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbound contact centres.</li>
<li>Outbound contact centres.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inbound contact centres deal with enquiries from customers &#8211; providing advice, information, updates, and dealing with complaints.</p>
<p>Outbound contact centres are those that reach out to individuals &#8211; traditionally by phone.</p>
<p>In an eCommerce context, a contact centre will generally combine both of these functions &#8211; dealing with inbound enquiries from customers, and providing outbound communications, for example letting customers know about a change in the status of their order.</p>
<h2>What is contact centre outsourcing?</h2>
<p>Contact centre outsourcing refers to the scenario in which an eCommerce business partners with a third party who will run their contact centre on their behalf.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than going to the time and expense of setting up a contact centre in-house, an eCommerce brand chooses an outside company to deal with their inbound and outbound customer service requirements.</p>
<h2>The advantages of contact centre outsourcing</h2>
<p>Outsourcing your contact centre requirements can have a number of benefits for eCommerce brands. This is especially true if your eCommerce brand is in the early stages of growth and development.</p>
<p>Below, you’ll find the top benefits of contact centre outsourcing.</p>
<h3><strong>It’s cost-effective</strong></h3>
<p>Setting up a dedicated contact centre isn’t cheap. You need to pay for staff, equipment, software, and office space (and that’s just for starters!).</p>
<p>These are a mix of upfront and ongoing costs &#8211; which tie up a lot of your capital. This is capital which could often be better used on activities that’ll further grow your business, such as sales and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your contact centre to a third party, you’ll be able to benefit from great customer service, but at a fraction of the cost of setting up a contact centre in-house.</p>
<h3><strong>It improves customer experience</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re running a rapidly growing eCommerce brand, then you’re probably struggling to stay on top of the amount of customer enquiries you’re receiving.</p>
<p>This can lead to a sour taste in many consumers’ mouths.</p>
<p>With large eCommerce brands being able to provide answers to customer queries around the clock, customers have become used to getting relevant, comprehensive answers <strong>quickly</strong>.</p>
<p>If your brand is to compete in the crowded eCommerce space, you need to be able to respond to customers in the same timely fashion.</p>
<p>Outsourcing your contact centre allows you to do just that.</p>
<h3><strong>Access to expertise</strong></h3>
<p>Handling customer enquiries &#8211; especially varied enquiries &#8211; is a specialist skill.</p>
<p>It’s a skill that you and your internal team may not be particularly adept at. This is why it makes sense to outsource your contact centre to a specialist.</p>
<p>Think of it this way; a third party contact centre provider is focused <em>solely</em> on dealing with customer enquiries. They’ll have the experience, systems, processes, and people to deal with large volumes of enquiries professionally.</p>
<p>That’s something that would take you and your internal team likely years to develop.</p>
<p>Third party contact centres also tend to have advanced data collection tools and will be able to provide you with detailed analytics such as average wait times, the number of different types of enquiries and more.</p>
<p>These can be incredibly valuable insights and, again, aren’t something you’d necessarily be able to develop in-house.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved customer retention</strong></h3>
<p>According to a survey conducted by Gravy Solutions, 69% of people shop more frequently with brands that offer consistent customer service.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your contact centre, you can capture that 69% of people, with consistently good customer service.</p>
<p>Third party contact centres are incentivised to offer the very best customer service &#8211; plus, you can quantify this by asking them to report on KPIs around customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved availability</strong></h3>
<p>Related to the above point, outsourced contact centres can improve your customer retention rate simply because they make you more available to your customers.</p>
<p>What we mean by this, is that outsourced contact centres can be available 24-7 (or at least extended hours), so your customers can get the answers they want at any time of day.</p>
<p>This puts you on a similar footing to the very biggest eCommerce brands like Amazon, where customers return time after time because they can always get an answer about their orders…</p>
<h2>The disadvantages of contact centre outsourcing</h2>
<p>Like any form of outsourcing, contact centre outsourcing does have a few disadvantages. We’ve outlined these drawbacks below.</p>
<h3><strong>Less control</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re very concerned over controlling your brand’s messaging, then outsourcing your contact centre can diminish your level of control.</p>
<p>This is only a minor drawback, however, as many third party contact centre providers will work closely with you to establish things like tone of voice, the key messages that need to be conveyed etc.</p>
<h3><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>This isn’t a universal drawback, but rather a note of warning.</p>
<p>If you don’t select the right third party contact centre provider, then you may find they don’t have the detailed industry knowledge that is needed to provide a proper level of service to your customers.</p>
<p>This can be solved by only working with a third party contact centre that can provide a demonstrated track record of working in your industry.</p>
<h3><strong>Lack of qualitative feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Third party contact centres will be able to provide you with detailed analytics regarding call volumes and types. However, they may not be able to provide you with qualitative feedback, such as customer comments on the quality of your service or products.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily the end of the world though, as it’s possible for eCommerce brands to gather this qualitative feedback through other channels such as email surveys, social media platforms and on-site chatbots.</p>
<h2>How outsourcing your contact centre can enhance the customer experience</h2>
<p>As we’ve just seen, contact centre outsourcing comes with a whole host of benefits. Here at 3PL, our outsourced contact centre service stands out from the rest. Here’s why:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you hoping to significantly grow your eCommerce business in 2023? Then there’s one particular skill that can help you achieve this &#8211; demand forecasting. To find out more about demand forecasting and how to apply it in your business, keep reading…</p>
<h2>What is eCommerce demand forecasting?</h2>
<p>eCommerce <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/demand-forecasting/">demand forecasting</a> refers to the process of predicting future demand for your products.</p>
<p>Demand forecasting can cover your entire inventory, be it products which you’ve been selling for years, or new products that you’re thinking about stocking.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create a demand forecast using a number of sources, however the most common source of data is historical sales records &#8211; which are typically drawn from an eCommerce business’ order management system.</p>
<h2>Why is eCommerce demand forecasting important?</h2>
<p>As you’ll be aware &#8211; running an eCommerce business, particularly one that is growing or at scale &#8211; is a complex, challenging affair.</p>
<p>Not only are you likely to have lots of inventory to deal with, but you’ll have the challenge of fulfilling orders to different parts of the country, dealing with supply chain disruptions and more.</p>
<p>Not to mention your competitors! Today’s eCommerce industry is becoming more competitive than ever. You not only have to compete with the giants such as Amazon, but a continual influx of new start-ups too.</p>
<p>That all adds up to a scenario where the answer is demand forecasting.</p>
<p>Demand forecasting can help you to avoid the mistakes that can result in your customers going elsewhere and your business failing to grow.</p>
<p>The types of mistakes that demand forecasting can help you avoid, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running out of stock during peak sales periods, losing you valuable customers.</li>
<li>Overspending on inventory that doesn’t sell &#8211; leaving you with valuable capital tied up in stock.</li>
<li>Struggling with cash flow as a result of capital being tied up in slow moving items of inventory.</li>
<li>Having to spend too much on overheads due to incorrect inventory allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the different types of eCommerce demand forecasting?</h2>
<p>Depending on the scale of your eCommerce business, the retail niche you work in, and the markets you serve, different types of eCommerce demand forecasts will be more suitable for you.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve detailed some of the most common types of eCommerce demand forecasting by level and time.</p>
<h3>Macro-level</h3>
<p>A macro-level demand forecast examines future demand in the broadest possible way.</p>
<p>This type of forecast examines the wider market and economic conditions in which an eCommerce business is operating. Such a forecast will consider things like inflation, consumer confidence, government fiscal policy and more.</p>
<p>Because macro-level demand forecasts are so broad &#8211; and encompass so many varying factors &#8211; they are more suited to larger businesses which are able to fund this level of market research.</p>
<h3>Micro-level</h3>
<p>A micro-level demand forecast is one that takes a ‘deep-dive’ into an individual eCommerce company’s operations and performance.</p>
<p>This type of demand forecast understands that individual eCommerce firms can do very little to influence macro factors, and instead focuses on things that a firm <em>can influence.</em></p>
<p>Factors that will be taken into account in a micro-level demand forecast include past sales performance of key categories, profit margins of individual items, and the cost of production and cash flow and how these things impact inventory.</p>
<p>Aside from demand forecasts that take either a broad or very narrow view, there are also demand forecasts that look at differing lengths of time. These are short-term and long-term demand forecasts.</p>
<h3>Short-term</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a short-term demand forecast looks at potential demand over a shorter period of time &#8211; typically looking at a three to 12-month period.</p>
<p>Short-term demand forecasts are particularly good for businesses that are affected by seasonality. For example, if you sell tents and outdoor equipment, a forecast will look ahead to the next summer &#8211; having looked at the previous summer’s sales data to determine how much stock will be needed.</p>
<h3>Long-term</h3>
<p>A long–term demand forecast will normally attempt to anticipate demand anywhere from 12 months to three years ahead.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for conducting a long-term demand forecast is to determine whether you should introduce new products and product lines into your business. Likewise, a long-term demand forecast will examine whether your business needs to adopt new sales channels.</p>
<p>Because this type of forecast is covering a longer period of time, it’s better able to observe changes in consumer purchasing habits and trends.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re thinking about social commerce (e.g. selling directly to consumers through platforms like TikTok and Instagram), then a long-term forecast can help you determine whether this will be a worthwhile investment or not.</p>
<h2>How to conduct a demand forecast for your eCommerce business</h2>
<p>As you have read so far, conducting a demand forecast is certainly a worthwhile exercise for the majority of eCommerce brands. But, if you want to conduct one, what are the next steps?</p>
<h3>Select targets</h3>
<p>Before you dive in and start pulling months and years of sales data from your systems, you should first set some targets; in other words, think about the questions you want the forecast to answer.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified these questions and targets, you can start crafting a forecast that actually helps to answer them.</p>
<h3>Collect and save data</h3>
<p>The foundation of any successful forecast is good, clean, accurate data. If you’re going to effectively answer the questions you set out earlier, you’re going to need the data that’ll provide the answers.</p>
<p>The most important data for your forecast will be your sales data. Accessing this data is usually as straightforward as downloading it from your CRM or order management platform.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that a good forecast will also look at wider trends &#8211; including competitors, the wider market, the economy &#8211; so remember to include some of this data from outside your business.</p>
<h3>Data analysis</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gathered all of your data, it’s time to analyse it.</p>
<p>If you’re a smaller eCommerce company, then it should be possible to do this manually, using spreadsheets and charts to identify key sales/demand trends.</p>
<p>However, if you’re a very large eCommerce company, it’s likely that you’ll need to call in the services of a professional data analyst to help you manipulate and handle the data to yield useful insights and trends.</p>
<h3>Ongoing adjustments</h3>
<p>Having completed your forecast, you want to make sure it doesn’t sit on a shelf gathering dust.</p>
<p>Instead, you want to put your money where your mouth is, and start implementing changes within your business based on the forecast.</p>
<p>So, if your forecast indicates falling demand for a particular line of products, make sure your reorder points are changed so that you keep less of that particular item in stock.</p>
<p>Implementing your forecast can certainly be daunting, but the other option &#8211; working based on sheer guesswork &#8211; is far worse!</p>
<h2>Ensure your inventory and fulfilment is on point with 3PL</h2>
<p>You may have created the finest demand forecast in the world, but if you struggle to manage your inventory and process and fulfil orders efficiently, you may as well not have a forecast!</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to stay on top of your inventory and fulfilment, then why not consider outsourcing it to an expert third-party logistics business like 3PL?</p>
<p>We take away the hassle of managing your own inventory and fulfilment so that you can focus on what you do best &#8211; marketing and selling your awesome products!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost of living crisis is dominating headlines. But, it’s not just individuals that are feeling the pinch. eCommerce businesses are, too. If you can identify with that last sentence, then keep reading, and we’ll tell you how outsourcing your fulfilment to 3PL can help your brand to cut costs and become more profitable…</p>
<h2>The cost of living crisis and how it impacts your business</h2>
<p>If you run an eCommerce business, then you’ve undoubtedly noticed that costs for all sorts of business essentials have been rising over the past six to 12 months.</p>
<p>Whether it’s your energy bills, the cost of materials, or your wage bill, it must seem like every part of your business is becoming more expensive to run.</p>
<p>You’re not alone.</p>
<p>According to a survey carried out by Nucleus Commercial Finance, 72% of business owners say the current cost of living crisis is a major concern regarding the survival or growth of their business.</p>
<p>The same survey also highlighted the key areas where rising costs are most pressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rising cost of energy.</li>
<li>Cash flow.</li>
<li>Employee retention.</li>
<li>Transportation costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous reasons as to why costs are rising in these areas, but there are two overarching themes that have been identified as being responsible for rising costs.</p>
<h3>The COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
<p>One of the key drivers of inflation has been identified as the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>With the economy effectively being put ‘on ice’ for long periods of time, this resulted in very significant disruptions to supply chains, huge changes in demand profiles and more.</p>
<p>This has resulted in significant levels of inflation across the world &#8211; the UK is expected to see inflation of 11% by the end of this year &#8211; and as a result rising prices for a whole range of basic business inputs such as materials and goods.</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>With the introduction of the COVID-19 lockdowns, demand for oil and gas collapsed. This resulted in the cancellation of numerous large oil and gas projects around the world.</p>
<p>As demand for energy returned following the ending of lockdowns, we found that the energy industry was only able to offer constrained supply &#8211; resulting in higher prices for energy.</p>
<p>This curtailed energy supply situation was greatly worsened following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. With Russia closing off major gas pipelines to Europe, the cost of energy has risen yet higher.</p>
<p>These overarching themes are the reason that eCommerce brands are facing rising costs in nearly every part of their business.</p>
<p>So, what’s the answer?</p>
<p>One of the key things you can do to help your business cut costs and increase your profit margins, is to outsource your fulfilment to 3PL.</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<h2>Why outsourcing your fulfilment can save your business money</h2>
<p>If you’re an eCommerce business, then you’ll no doubt be aware that the process of fulfilment involves numerous inputs &#8211; inputs which cost you money.</p>
<p>Fulfilment also requires a significant knowledge base; something which can be difficult to develop when you’re focusing on the wider operational aspects of your business.</p>
<p>The solution to these problems (and more), is to outsource your fulfilment to what’s known as a third-party logistics provider. Below, we’ve set out the many benefits associated with doing this.</p>
<h3>Expertise</h3>
<p>The chances are, you’re an expert when it comes to the products you sell. But, are you an expert at running fulfilment at scale?</p>
<p>If you’re not, then it makes sense to outsource your fulfilment to a dedicated third-party fulfilment provider like ourselves here at 3PL.</p>
<p>Companies like 3PL do nothing but fulfilment for other companies. It’s their sole job to ensure that your fulfilment process is run as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
<p>By choosing experts to carry out your fulfilment, you’ll be reducing the number of costly mistakes that you’d incur if you tried to run all of your fulfilment in-house.</p>
<h3>Better labour allocation</h3>
<p>As you’re probably aware, running fulfilment operations in-house can be a rather labour-intensive affair.</p>
<p>Not only do you need people to process orders, but you need people to manage inventory, run the pick and pack process, maintain customer communications, arrange delivery and negotiate with couriers etc. There’s a lot to do!</p>
<p>By outsourcing your fulfilment to 3PL, you can allocate your employees to more value-add tasks such as marketing or sales, improving your revenue and profitability.</p>
<h3>Reduced material costs</h3>
<p>Customers expect orders they place with eCommerce stores to arrive perfectly packaged.</p>
<p>But, in today&#8217;s world of increasing materials costs, this can end up costing you a small fortune.</p>
<p>If you outsource your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider, then you can significantly reduce, even eliminate, these costs.</p>
<p>A provider like 3PL will include the packaging of orders within their service. Plus, because 3PL provides packaging services to tens of other eCommerce brands, it is able to make use of economies of scale to purchase packaging materials at rates far lower than an individual brand could ever hope to negotiate.</p>
<p>The result is that you get packaging at far lower costs than if you were to try to buy it yourself.</p>
<h3>Reduced fixed capital</h3>
<p>If you attempt to run your fulfilment in-house, you’ll quickly find that much of your capital quickly becomes tied up in fixed assets.</p>
<p>For example, as you grow, you’ll need to invest in a larger warehouse for your inventory. You’ll need to invest in fixtures and fittings for the warehouse. You’ll need to invest in fulfilment software and tech to run the warehouse and associated fulfilment operations.</p>
<p>These things tie up your capital in assets which aren’t necessarily the best use of that capital.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your fulfilment to 3PL, you won’t have to invest your hard-earned capital in fixed assets, and instead can use it for more growth-oriented activities such as sales and marketing campaigns instead.</p>
<p>You’ll also benefit from economies of scale, too. Because a 3PL carries out fulfilment on behalf of multiple brands, you’ll benefit from having a large, modern warehouse for your inventory (which you probably couldn’t afford if you were running fulfilment in-house).</p>
<h3>Lower transportation costs</h3>
<p>With fuel costs being a major driver of inflation, the cost of transporting orders to customers is one of the biggest things that is cutting into the profits of eCommerce brands at present.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably found, couriers are being faced with much bigger fuel bills, and they are passing these costs onto you &#8211; the customer.</p>
<p>However, there is a solution. Yes, that’s right! Outsourcing your fulfilment to 3PL.</p>
<p>It’s about negotiating power.</p>
<p>At 3PL, we carry out fulfilment for multiple eCommerce brands, meaning we send hundreds (even thousands) of parcels from our distribution centres each day.</p>
<p>This means that we are able to negotiate very competitive rates from our pool of courier companies. These rates are far cheaper than an eCommerce brand would be able to negotiate on their own.</p>
<p>Thus, it makes sense to outsource your fulfilment to 3PL, and benefit from significant cost savings across every point of your fulfilment process!</p>
<h2>Outsource your fulfilment to 3PL today</h2>
<p>With the peak selling season nearly upon us, and little sign of the cost of living crisis abating, there’s never been a better time to outsource your fulfilment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/case-studies/">We work with eCommerce brands</a> big and small to ensure their fulfilment is as cost-effective as possible, helping them to achieve higher revenues and better profit margins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The festive season is rapidly approaching on the horizon. And, with it, comes the opportunity to make some of the biggest sales of the year for your eCommerce brand. This opportunity also comes with a challenge &#8211; shipping. <strong><em>If you want to nail your holiday shipping this year, then keep reading and the 3PL team will tell you everything you need to know…</em></strong></p>
<h2>1. Organise your warehouse</h2>
<p>In the run-up to the holiday period, you should take the opportunity to get your warehouse as organised as possible.</p>
<p>After all, your warehouse is where the shipping process begins. You want to make sure that your warehouse is as organised as possible, so that when all those holiday orders start pouring in, you and your warehouse team can fulfil them as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to map out your warehouse’s floor plan and discuss any pain points that currently exist with your fulfilment team. It’s likely they’ve spotted potential improvements that you’ve missed (such as changing the locations of popular product lines, etc).</p>
<h2>2. Talk to your suppliers</h2>
<p>In addition to making sure your warehouse is in order, you want to make sure your inventory is in order, too.</p>
<p>As such, reach out to your suppliers as early as possible and discuss your holiday inventory requirements.</p>
<p>Where possible, share your predicted order volumes, which lines are likely to prove the most popular, and when you’re going to need to replenish these lines. By coordinating closely with your suppliers, you can avoid running out of stock during one of the busiest times of year.</p>
<h2>3. Mark out key dates in your calendar</h2>
<p>Make sure that everyone in your business is aware of the biggest shopping days over the holiday period.</p>
<p>It can be all too easy for these big sales days to creep up on you and your team. So make sure that everyone is aware of these dates, and ensure they are scheduling leave, arranging rotas etc that take them into account.</p>
<p>These exact dates will vary depending on your eCommerce brand, but major sales dates during the holiday period include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Friday &#8211; Friday 25th November 2022.</li>
<li>Cyber Monday &#8211; Monday 28th November 2022.</li>
<li>Christmas Day &#8211; Sunday 25th December 2022.</li>
<li>Boxing Day &#8211; Monday 26th December 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Talk to your delivery companies</h2>
<p>According to research conducted by Salesforce, last-mile delivery services are expected to exceed capacity by 5% during 2022’s holiday season.</p>
<p>That potentially translates into fierce competition for delivery slots, delayed deliveries and even missed deliveries.</p>
<p>As such, you want to gain a clear picture of your delivery company’s holiday shipping requirements. For example, your delivery company may extend delivery lead times, put in place new rules, or even different pricing structures (such as surge pricing).</p>
<p>This can not only impact customer satisfaction, but also your bottom line. So, talk to your delivery company about their holiday shipping requirements sooner rather than later!</p>
<h2>5. Offer free shipping for the holidays</h2>
<p>These days, there’s more competition for holiday-season spending than ever before.</p>
<p>Which makes offering free shipping a good idea.</p>
<p>Sure, you’ll incur higher costs, but this can be more than offset by the higher volume of orders you’ll potentially receive.</p>
<p>If you want to try to mitigate the higher costs you’ll incur by offering free shipping, you could factor in shipping costs to your product prices.</p>
<h2>6. Ensure you’re offering order tracking</h2>
<p>When a customer has ordered a product from you during the holiday season, they’re almost certainly ordering it for a set date, e.g. Christmas Day.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it’s essential that you offer your customers order tracking, so they can see the progress of their order &#8211; and ease any worries they may have.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that customers look at order tracking pages 3.5 times per order (and in some instances, as many as five times per order!). Order tracking is <em>that</em> important.</p>
<p>What customers DON’T want is for their order to disappear into a black hole. If they can’t see where their order is, they’re more likely to call you &#8211; resulting in more work for your customer service team and decreased satisfaction for the customer.</p>
<h2>7. Communicate, communicate, communicate</h2>
<p>Following on from the point above, it’s vital that your customer service processes are up to scratch ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you need to make sure you are communicating with your customers in a transparent and honest way.</p>
<p>If an order is going to be delayed, then communicate that. By being as honest and transparent as possible, you’ll find that customers will be more understanding.</p>
<p>What customers won’t like is being kept in the dark about their orders. So, even if it’s bad news, make sure you communicate it!</p>
<h2>8. Scale up your fulfilment team</h2>
<p>If you’re expecting a particularly large surge in order volumes over the holiday period, then it&#8217;s a good idea to scale up your fulfilment team.</p>
<p>Should you decide to do this, and hire temporary workers, make sure you hire them in advance of the holiday period so that you have sufficient time to train them and integrate them into your existing fulfilment team.</p>
<h2>9. Use holiday-specific packaging and inserts</h2>
<p>The holidays are a special time of year. So, why not convey some of that feeling via your packaging?</p>
<p>Even if you just add holiday-themed inserts to your orders, this can create a more joyous unboxing experience &#8211; increasing the chances that your customers will shop with you again in the future.</p>
<h2>10. Outsource your holiday shipping and fulfilment</h2>
<p>If you’ve read all of the above and come to the conclusion that it’s a lot of work, you’d be right!</p>
<p>The above best practices are absolutely worthwhile, but we understand that it can be quite a daunting task. Particularly given how steep the learning curve can be for many aspects of holiday shipping and fulfilment.</p>
<p>That’s why it can make sense to outsource your holiday shipping and fulfilment to a 3PL (also known as a third-party logistics provider).</p>
<p>3PLs are able to take care of your entire fulfilment and shipping process from end to end. And, because this is their sole job, they’re experts at it!</p>
<p>Plus, because 3PL’s undertake fulfilment and shipping on behalf of multiple brands, they are able to achieve economies of scale, and negotiate highly competitive shipping rates that you alone could not.</p>

		<p>Today, more than ever, consumers don’t restrict their shopping habits to individual channels. Be it online marketplaces, eCommerce stores, or social media channels, consumers want to be able to buy your products from a number of channels. Which makes having a successful omnichannel order fulfilment strategy support important. <strong><em>Find out how to make your omnichannel fulfilment successful below…</em></strong></p>
<h2>Why is omnichannel eCommerce important?</h2>
<p>How do you currently sell your products? If you’re reading this, the chances are you sell your products via an online store.</p>
<p>But, do you also sell your products through other channels such as Amazon, eBay or via social media platforms like Instagram?</p>
<p>Because, if you aren’t, you should be.</p>
<p>Selling your products through multiple channels is what’s known as omnichannel retail or omnichannel eCommerce.</p>
<p>The key point about omnichannel eCommerce is that <strong>it provides you with a much bigger audience of potential customers</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it, though. According to a study of 46,000 shoppers, 73% of online shoppers use multiple channels while purchasing online.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re restricting the promotion and sale of your products to only one or two channels (such as your online store), then you’re going to be losing out on potentially large numbers of sales.</p>
<p>“Very well, then”, you say. “I’ll start selling my goods through some additional channels”.</p>
<p>Great! That’s a brilliant decision! But, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/7-strategies-to-supercharge-your-omnichannel-ecommerce-growth/">with the transition to omnichannel eCommerce</a>, you’ll also have to delve into the world of omnichannel fulfilment…</p>
<h2>What is omnichannel fulfilment?</h2>
<p>Say you took our advice, and you’re promoting and selling your goods across a variety of channels.</p>
<p>You’re, now (hopefully!), receiving orders from each of these channels.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/a-guide-to-omnichannel-fulfilment/">Omnichannel </a><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/a-guide-to-omnichannel-fulfilment/">fulfilment</a><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/a-guide-to-omnichannel-fulfilment/">,</a> then, simply refers to the process of fulfilling orders from multiple different sales channels, in an integrated, uniform way.</p>
<p>So, whether you receive an order from your online store, or an order from your Amazon merchant account, you have a consistent, documented process for handling that order and getting it to the end customer.</p>
<p>Omnichannel fulfilment typically takes the form of having a <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">single digital dashboard</a>, which is integrated with your different sales channels. This allows you to see your orders in a single place, providing maximum visibility and ensuring that no order gets overlooked.</p>
<p>Your orders will then be processed, drawn from inventory in a warehouse (or warehouses), picked, packed and shipped to the customer.</p>
<p>You can tell if you’ve achieved a successful omnichannel fulfilment process if your customers can’t tell the difference whether they have ordered from you using Amazon, eBay, your online store or any other channel.</p>
<h2>The secrets to a successful omnichannel order fulfilment strategy</h2>
<p>It’s all very well talking about how important a smooth, seamless, omnichannel fulfilment process is, but how exactly do you go about achieving it?</p>
<p>3PL’s fulfilment experts have provided their top tips below.</p>
<h3><strong>Order visibility</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important part of creating a successful omnichannel fulfilment strategy is ensuring your team has complete visibility over all of your orders.</p>
<p>Moving from receiving orders from a single channel (e.g. your online store), to multiple (e.g. your online store, Amazon, and eBay), makes order visibility more important than ever. If you lose track of orders or forget about them completely, it won’t be long before you have an angry customer on the phone!</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the best way to maintain order visibility across multiple channels is to invest in a <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">digital dashboard</a> that integrates all of your retail channels and funnels them all into a single place.</p>
<h3><strong>Inventory management</strong></h3>
<p>With orders being received from multiple retail channels, it’s vital that you keep your inventory as up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>This is especially true if you are fulfilling all of your orders from a single inventory.</p>
<p>It’s also important that you keep your inventory up-to-date at all times if you are working with retail channels such as Amazon, as you can be penalised if you advertise products as being in stock when they aren’t.</p>
<p>Partnering with a <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/">3PL</a> can help eliminate inventory control worries, as a third-party logistics provider will be able to take care of your inventory management on your behalf.</p>
<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>
<p>Communication, communication, communication! These should be the watchwords of your omnichannel fulfilment strategy.</p>
<p>Whether a customer is ordering from your online store, eBay, or a social channel like Instagram, it’s vital that you communicate with them through every stage of their purchasing journey.</p>
<p>The days of being able to make do with an order receipt email are over.</p>
<p>By partnering with a third-party logistics provider like 3PL, this communication can be handled on your behalf. That’s because companies like 3PL are able to provide real-time updates on despatches, carrier tracking, returns and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Shipping</strong></h3>
<p>Regardless of where they have placed their order, consumers expect their orders to be correct, well-packaged, and to arrive on time.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s crucial that you are able to quickly and efficiently pick, pack and ship orders.</p>
<p>Whilst this sounds simple, it’s important to be aware that certain retails channels (particularly Amazon), have specific requirements as to how orders should be packaged and shipped.</p>
<p>That’s why it often makes the most sense to outsource your omnichannel fulfilment to a specialist provider like 3PL, which has extensive experience dealing with the specific shipping requirements of multiple retail channels.</p>
<h3><strong>Returns</strong></h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re selling your goods via your online store, a social media platform or an online marketplace, you’re going to have to deal with returns.</p>
<p>In fact, according to research recently conducted by Shopify, ‘a quarter of all consumers return between 5% and 15% of the items they buy online’.</p>
<p>So, handling returns needs to be an important cornerstone of your omnichannel fulfilment strategy.</p>
<p>And, like shipping, many online retail channels have their own specific requirements for dealing with returns. Therefore, the learning curve for handling returns across multiple channels can be steep.</p>
<p>But, not if you outsource your omnichannel fulfilment. Companies like 3PL are set up to handle returns across multiple retail channels and are adept at handling the specific requirements of multiple retail channels.</p>
<h2><strong>Outsource your omnichannel order fulfilment today</strong></h2>
<p>As you’ve just read, there are a number of different ingredients that go into the ‘secret sauce’ of a successful omnichannel order fulfilment strategy.</p>
<p>Many of these ingredients require extensive experience and expertise in order to get them right. That’s why it makes sense to outsource your omnichannel order fulfilment to a specialist provider like 3PL.</p>
<p>Not only will your omnichannel order fulfilment be smoother, more efficient and keep customers happy, but you’ll find it’s far more cost-effective than having to do it all yourself.</p>

		<p>If you want to create a streamlined, efficient and above all effective fulfilment process for your business, then you need to ensure that you’re using the most effective pick and pack strategy. To find out which pick and pack strategy is most effective for you, keep reading…</p>
<h2>What is pick and pack fulfilment?</h2>
<p>The pick and pack fulfilment process is the first stage in the overall fulfilment process, following the receipt and confirmation of an order. It refers to the process whereby the items that have been ordered are picked and then packed by a warehouse/fulfilment team.</p>
<p>Whilst the act of picking and packing an order may sound simple, it’s in fact more complex than many people realise and if not carried out correctly can result in order delays, inaccuracies, the delivery of damaged goods and more.</p>
<p>So, it’s vital that your pick and pack fulfilment process is accurate, efficient and effective.</p>
<h2>What are the different pick and pack fulfilment strategies?</h2>
<p>Whilst the concept of picking and packing orders sounds straightforward, there are actually a number of different pick and pack strategies; each of which lends itself to certain types and sizes of business and industry.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve outlined the most commonly used pick and pack fulfilment strategies.</p>
<h3>Batch picking</h3>
<p>Batch picking involves members of your fulfilment team going out into your warehouse and picking the items for multiple orders at once.</p>
<p>Your fulfilment team members will effectively be walking around your warehouse building up multiple orders as they go along.</p>
<p>This can help create efficiencies as they are not continually retracing their steps.</p>
<h3>Piece picking</h3>
<p>In contrast to batch picking, piece picking involves the members of your fulfilment team picking out items for individual orders, one at a time.</p>
<p>This piece picking strategy generally lends itself better to smaller eCommerce operations that have a lower overall volume of orders. It’s also a good pick and pack strategy if you tend to sell large items on a mostly individual basis.</p>
<h3>Zone picking</h3>
<p>Zone picking is, as the name suggests, a picking strategy that involves your fulfilment team members being assigned to specific zones within your warehouse.</p>
<p>Those team members are instructed only to collect items for orders from their assigned zone. If an item is required from another zone, then the team member ‘hands off’ the order as it stands on to a team member in the other, relevant zone.</p>
<p>Zone picking is generally more suited for larger operations, where large warehouses are in operation. With the addition of conveyor belts, a zone picking strategy can make picking at scale far more efficient.</p>
<h3>Wave picking</h3>
<p>The wave picking strategy combines the best of both batch picking and zone picking methods, ensuring that fulfilment team members stay within their designated zones, but simultaneously picking items for more than one order at a time.</p>
<p>Whilst wave picking does improve shipping time, reduce bottlenecks and is all-round highly efficient, it does require in-depth and complex data analysis &#8211; as such, it’s more suited to larger scale eCommerce businesses.</p>
<h2>How to improve your pick and pack fulfilment operations</h2>
<p>Regardless of the specific picking and packing strategy that you select, there are a number of overall best practices that you can use to improve the accuracy and efficiency of your pick and pack fulfilment operations.</p>
<p>The 3PL team has outlined their top tips for improving your pick and pack fulfilment operations below.</p>
<h3>Don’t mix SKUs!</h3>
<p>If you tend to store your inventory in a series of bins and boxes, it may be tempting to store multiple different small items in single bins.</p>
<p>But, don’t! It’s a recipe for picking disaster!</p>
<p>Not only does placing multiple different SKUs into a single bin reduce productivity (your pickers will have to spend time sorting through items in the bin), but it’s likely to lead to more incorrectly picked orders &#8211; resulting in unhappy customers, returns, refunds and more.</p>
<p>Whilst you may save some space by placing different SKUs into single bins, in the long run, you’ll regret it!</p>
<h3>Think about placement of inventory</h3>
<p>This is a difficult one, but it will certainly pay off. Give some serious thought about where the inventory gets placed in your warehouse.</p>
<p>Think of it this way &#8211; you don’t want your pickers to have to walk five minutes from picking up one item, to another.</p>
<p>Although it’s certainly easier to order your inventory based on SKU numbers etc, it’s actually far more efficient to order it based on items that are frequently ordered together. For example, if you stock stationery, then it makes sense to place pens close to pads and notebooks.</p>
<h3>Consider inventory turnover speed</h3>
<p>Do you have any particularly fast-moving items of inventory? Equally, do you have some inventory which takes much longer to sell?</p>
<p>If so, make sure you place your fast-moving, popular items of inventory in prime areas within your warehouse &#8211; those areas that are close to packing stations and which are easy to access.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have slower, less-popular items of inventory then move them to the less accessible parts of your warehouse.</p>
<h3>Use the right racks</h3>
<p>In addition to thinking about where to place your popular and less-popular items of inventory, give some thought to the type of racking you have in your warehouse.</p>
<p>Racks such as floor racks are far easier and faster for pickers to access on foot. On the other hand, if you’re planning on automating some or all of your picking process, then elevated racks are far easier to use in conjunction with conveyor belts and automated picking systems.</p>
<h3>Use RFID</h3>
<p>RFID &#8211; which stands for radio frequency identification &#8211; is a system which uses handsets and chips equipped with small antennas to track location of inventory throughout a warehouse.</p>
<p>Whilst RFID is an investment, it will generally pay for itself as it provides real-time information on the location of inventory to your picking teams, vastly improving productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>RFID is particularly useful once you are operating at scale and have a large warehouse or even multiple warehouses.</p>
<h3>Outsource your picking and packing</h3>
<p>If you want to benefit from the very best picking and packing fulfilment strategy then it’s recommended that you outsource your picking and packing to a 3PL.</p>
<p>A 3PL (otherwise known as a third-party logistics provider), is a company that specialises in carrying out pick and pack fulfilment on behalf of other companies.</p>
<p>Pick the right provider &#8211; like ourselves here at 3PL &#8211; and you’ll find that your picking and packing fulfilment is carried out in the most efficient and accurate way possible, leaving you free to focus on what you do best, marketing and selling your amazing products!</p>

		<p>Are you sick and tired of dealing with middlemen? Do you want to avoid the hassle of haggling with retailers and marketplaces? Then you could benefit from adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment strategy. Want to know more about this emergent fulfilment model? <strong><em>Then keep reading and 3PL will tell you everything you need to know about D2C eCommerce fulfilment…</em></strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What is D2C eCommerce fulfilment?</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. What exactly is D2C eCommerce fulfilment?</p>
<p>Well, as the name suggests, direct to consumer (D2C) fulfilment involves a manufacturer of a product marketing and selling their products directly to a consumer, leaving out the usual intermediaries such as retailers and marketplaces.</p>
<p>Direct to consumer brands are able to design and manufacture their own products, conduct their own marketing (with the vast majority of this marketing taking place on social media platforms), and fulfil the products themselves, creating a direct relationship with their customer base.</p>
<p>You may not realise it, but you’ve probably purchased products from D2C brands yourself. Some of the biggest and most well-known D2C brands include Dollar Shave Club, Casper, Warby Parker, Gymshark, Gousto, Glossier, and many others.</p>
<h2>The rise and rise of D2C eCommerce fulfilment</h2>
<p>As those brand names indicate, the D2C business model has become big business in recent years.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, direct to consumer brands generated an enormous £96 billion in sales in 2020. And, that number is only set to grow.</p>
<p>According to market research firm Statista, the direct to consumer market in the UK is set to be worth £120 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story in other countries, with the D2C market expected to be worth $175 billion in the US by 2023.</p>
<p>It’s big business. So much so, that big businesses are now getting in on the D2C act themselves.</p>
<p>Whilst the initial D2C brands to make it big were digitally-native startups, an increasing number of very large established brands are now adopting the direct to consumer fulfilment model. Think Apple, GAP and other established businesses that have moved more to a direct to consumer model rather than selling through intermediaries.</p>
<p>Other major established businesses have gone one further and simply acquired popular direct to consumer brands outright. Perhaps the best example of this is Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by the multinational Unilever for $1 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>So, if you’re thinking about adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model for your eCommerce brand, you’ll be in very good company.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of direct to consumer fulfilment?</h2>
<p>There must be some good reasons as to why so many brands &#8211; new and old alike &#8211; are adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model.</p>
<p>We’ve touched on some of these reasons above, but to really drive the point home, we’ve set out the key benefits of D2C fulfilment in more detail below.</p>
<h3>Control</h3>
<p>With direct to consumer fulfilment, the destiny of your brand is completely in your hands.</p>
<p>You have complete control over every part of your brand and its products. From the design and manufacture of your products to the way in which they are marketed, to the way in which your products reach your customers, you are in control.</p>
<p>You won’t be beholden to the whims of retailers and marketplaces, who will often want a say in pricing, marketing and other important factors.</p>
<h3>Brand messaging</h3>
<p>Related to the point above about control, by adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model, you’ll be able to determine your brand messaging with no outside interference.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell household consumables then you’ll be able to set a price point that reflects your brand. So, if you want your brand to be perceived as an aspirational and high end one, then you can set your prices slightly higher than equivalent competitors.</p>
<p>That’s not always possible when you’re selling through intermediaries such as supermarkets. In many cases, supermarkets will want you to commit to periodic discounting, bulk buy deals and other similar pricing tactics.</p>
<p>If you’re keen to maintain the integrity of your brand, then avoiding these sorts of tactics is a must, and is something that the D2C fulfilment model allows you to do.</p>
<h3>Margins</h3>
<p>Talking of pricing, we come to another major benefit of the direct to consumer fulfilment model &#8211; margins.</p>
<p>Because there are no middlemen involved, you can choose to either sell your products at a lower price point, beating your competitors and grabbing a larger share of the market, or you can sell your products and simply enjoy a higher profit margin.</p>
<p>Either way, the direct to consumer fulfilment model allows you to generate more revenue and/or profits.</p>
<h3>Direct access to your customers</h3>
<p>By selling directly you will have the opportunity to build strong relationships with your customers.</p>
<p>As you will be in contact with your customers through each stage of the sales process, from the initial marketing activity through to post-sales customer service, you’ll be able to form a much stronger bond with your customers than if you were to sell through intermediaries.</p>
<p>This essentially allows you to build up a base of customers that you ‘own’. You’ll be able to gather important data such as email addresses, location, purchasing preferences and more. All of which will help you to retain customers over the longer term.</p>
<h3>Brand loyalty</h3>
<p>The direct to consumer fulfilment model comes with another significant benefit &#8211; brand loyalty.</p>
<p>As you are able to maintain direct communications with your customers throughout the entire buying journey, you are able to make sure they have a great experience. This helps to establish strong brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, if you’re selling your products through an intermediary such as a brick and mortar store, there’s nothing stopping a stroppy sales assistant from completely spoiling the buying experience.</p>
<p>That kind of thing can rub off negatively on your brand… Selling directly to consumers eliminates the possibility of that kind of thing from happening.</p>
<h2>Why you should outsource your D2C fulfilment</h2>
<p>As you’ve seen so far, direct to consumer fulfilment has many benefits. But, it’s not without its challenges, particularly when it comes to the fulfilment-specific elements.</p>
<p>As your brand grows and the volume of your sales increases, you’ll typically experience the following fulfilment-related challenges:</p>

<li><strong>Difficulties scaling</strong> &#8211; at small volumes, fulfilment can be handled in-house with relative ease. You can pick, pack and fulfil orders with a small team. But, what happens when your business starts to scale? Trying to run a warehouse, arrange picking and packing, finding couriers etc, will be far more of a challenge. Outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party provider can solve this.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> &#8211; you can quickly find that more and more of your time is spent dealing with fulfilment-related issues. Whether it&#8217;s arranging for more warehousing space, or trying to negotiate deals with couriers, fulfilment can be a time sink. Outsourcing your fulfilment allows you to spend your time on other business-critical tasks such as product development, marketing and sales.</li>
<li><strong>Shipping costs</strong> &#8211; if you’re attempting to negotiate courier and shipping deals on your own, then you’re not going to be getting the best prices. That’s a fact. When you outsource your fulfilment to a third party, they are able to negotiate much more competitive prices, simply because they benefit from economies of scale and industry expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just a few of the reasons why you should consider outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL if you’re thinking of adopting a direct to consumer business model.</p>
