										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/category/inside-3pl/">Inside 3PL</a>, where we introduce you to the amazingly talented people that make 3PL such a fantastic place to work.</p>
<p>Today, it gives us great pleasure to introduce you to James Taylor<strong>, </strong>a Business Development Manager, who is responsible for identifying new business opportunities and building relationships with clients and partners.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet James? Let’s do it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To start, can you tell us a little bit about your background and what you do at 3PL? </strong><strong>What are you responsible for? </strong></p>
<p><strong>James Taylor (JT): </strong>I have worked within the recruitment industry for the past 10 years +. During this time, I specialised in the industrial sector, making the transition to 3PL much smoother. At 3PL my role as Business Development Manager has me focusing primarily on bringing new business onboard. As part of this, ensuring a quality introduction for new companies, working closely with our customer service team to ensure the needs of the customer are prioritised and working with those customers to enhance the growth of their businesses and elevate them to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to get into your current job role? </strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I love to meet and speak to people but also love the idea of a complex sell. It became apparent that the complexity of third-party logistics was a real interest. Working with businesses to provide solutions that will realise their growth potential is a real buzz for me.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> 3PL is a driven, professional business with a homely/community feel. With honesty and integrity at the forefront, it is an environment where everyone can be part of a great team and achieve their true potential.</p>
<p><strong>What does your day-to-day typically look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Woking with <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-john-scully-business-development-manager/">John</a>, I look to establish companies that are embarking on exponential growth which will see our services and solutions help transition their businesses to the next level. In addition to this, we look to highlight more established businesses that would use our services to relieve stress/pressure in other areas of their business, allowing them to grow organically.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite thing about working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> 3PL is a great work environment where the collective team has a common goal in ensuring customers’ expectations are exceeded. The future growth of our customers and the success of the business overall provide us with the daily motivation to succeed. Both elements form the 3PL DNA and it’s really refreshing to see and to be part of something special.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell our readers about how the order fulfilment and logistics industry has changed over the past years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> This industry has moved with the customer. Its flexibility has seen the solutions we provide mould into different guises which work to suit the solution that the customer requires. To stand still in this industry renders your relevance mute. Technology has played a huge part in this transformation. Technological advances have made the possibilities almost endless and timescales reduce out of recognition.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> During my early 20’s I spent 7 months in Australia playing cricket.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been your personal career highlight working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Meeting the team. Fantastic, driven team all working to continue to grow the business.</p>
<p><strong>What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Driven, Professional, Team</p>
<p><strong>What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> The people</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Come and enjoy it! Very welcoming environment so the usual nerves that surround starting a new role are not required.</p>

<p>Today, It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to <strong>Emanuel Marques Lourenco, </strong>a Full Stack Developer who is responsible for optimising our in-house 3PL technologies across the business.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet Emanuel? Let&#8217;s do it<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan: To start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at 3PL. What are you responsible for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emanuel Lourenco: </strong>I am responsible for maintaining and adding new features to the 3PL technology systems such as Fusion, our client-facing <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">Cloud Based Order Fulfilment Platform</a> or the 3PL mobile app used internally, designed to help our members of staff carry out a wide range of tasks that improve our speed of service.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to get into your current job role?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL:</strong> Ever since I remember, I have been fascinated by software/applications that in one way or another make people’s lives easier and better, and I’ve had the desire to learn how this is achieved and then apply myself to create something that does exactly that.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>I believed that at 3PL I could help the team by implementing new systems and features that make their jobs, whether it be a client or member of staff, a little bit easier and in logistics, this is essential as it involves a wide range of processes where the room for improvement and innovation is constantly present.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s been your favourite project to work on at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>Adding a scan to cage feature to our warehouse App was probably my favourite project because I got to directly deal with warehouse procedures and come up with ways to make it intuitive and helpful to the warehouse staff and make their lives a little bit easier.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Before working at 3PL what was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>Whilst being an intern at my university I was able to experiment with different technologies such as programable robots and VR setups.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>I was once the drummer of an amateur Christian rock band!</p>
<p><strong>BR: What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>Third-Party Logistics</p>
<p><strong>BR: What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>3PL is a company that is always looking to improve across all its different departments which makes it great for someone in my position as I get exposure to all of them, facing new challenges along the way.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What do you think creates a great customer experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>Customer needs are ever-changing and so it is great when their feedback and feature requests are met with actions from our part, where we can satisfy their needs and improve our service with them.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EL: </strong>Be ready for new challenges and ready to adapt to different situations and you will have a huge part to play in the company&#8217;s growth.</p>

		<p>Welcome back to Inside 3PL, where we introduce you to the amazingly talented people that make 3PL such an amazing place to work.</p>
<p>So far, you’ve met <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-john-scully-business-development-manager/" rel="">John Scully</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-hannah-banks-customer-support/">Hannah Banks</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-kath-knowles-value-added-services-manager/">Kath Knowles</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-rebecca-whalley-finance-admin-manager/" rel="">Rebecca Whalley,</a> <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-leon-parkinson-continuous-improvement-manager/" rel="">Leon Parkinson ,</a> and <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-linda-ashton-hr-manager/" rel="">Abbie Booth</a>.</p>
<p>Today, It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to <strong>Christian Glascott, </strong>Customer Support with the Wigan Athletic Community Trust as part of Kickstart. Through the government’s Kickstart scheme award-winning businesses like 3PL have been providing valuable work opportunities for ambitious youngsters like Christian in the Wigan Borough.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to learn more about Christian? Let’s do it<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan: To start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at 3PL. What are you responsible for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christian Glascott: </strong>I&#8217;m a member of the Customer Services Team at 3PL. Currently, I am mostly responsible for the tracking of shipments and stock. I also help raise claims with couriers over shipments that get lost or damaged.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to get into your current job role?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS:</strong> When I was younger, I had always wanted to be a teacher of history, <em>my favourite subject.</em> I had recently decided that, having experienced teaching, that the role was not really for me. When I reflected on what I was good at, I realised I was good at admin and customer services roles &#8211; I decided that I should get a job I could excel at.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>I had applied for multiple admin and customer service jobs with the Civil Service, I did well on the assessed tests but never had enough practical experience to get past the interview stages. So, I joined the Kickstart program to look for admin and customer service jobs, and I was offered a role at 3PL and it seemed like a great opportunity to work within a fast-growing company.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s been your favourite project to work on at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>So far, my favourite part has been the stock tracking, mostly because I have been able to see myself improve and get better with time.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Before working at 3PL what was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>I once worked in Sales. The work mostly involved door to door work, which you need a licence for. I quickly found out that there were people with less favourable attitudes towards door-to-door sales reps than I had.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>I enjoy taking part in my local pub quizzes.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>Welcoming. Honest. Focused.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>The people! 3PL has been the most welcoming company that I have ever worked for. It is a place where you feel welcome and part of the team from day one.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What do you think creates a great customer experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>When the customers’ expectations are exceeded by the service that is provided, and when they see both their rational and emotional needs met.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GS: </strong>Work hard and be yourself, I am sure that 3PL will be able to find a role suited to you and your skills.</p>

<p>Today, It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to <strong>Abbie Booth, </strong>Customer Support. Abbie brings enthusiasm, positivity and cat stories wherever she goes and is hugely popular with 3PL customers, building close personal relationships and always looking to go the extra mile to put a smile on their faces. (Take a look at what For Goodness Shakes had to say in their <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/case-studies/for-goodness-shakes/" rel="">customer success story</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet Abbie? Let’s do it<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan: To start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at 3PL. What are you responsible for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abbie Booth:</strong> Customer Account Management is all about being a <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/outsourced-contact-centre-services/" rel="">dedicated customer care contact</a> with the intention to always care for your customer. If there is a problem, it is your responsibility to fix that. Similarly, if something good happens it is our task to relay this to the wider business to allow for full visibility on customer gratitude. You have to build strong personal relationships with the customer and many conversations begin about work-related matters and you end laughing and joking, it is really incredible to be a part of.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to get into Customer Account Management?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> I am such a sociable person, speaking with different business leaders and having the power to make a positive impact on their day is so appealing for me. I think I have found a natural flare in a customer account management role within a logistics company because it allows me to problem solve and puts me under the sort of pressure that I thrive on daily.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> I spent the initial period of the pandemic in a customer-facing, key worker role and I decided that I had more potential, so I started to explore what fields I would enjoy working in that could use some of the key skills that I&#8217;ve learnt working in customer service for around 8 years. I saw the advertisement for 3PL and after reading what it entailed and doing my background research, I saw the opportunity to work for a fantastic company and I took it.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s been your favourite project to work on at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> I do really love customer support and account management; you get to see the start to end process and have the power to make a positive impact on somebody’s order experience. It is really satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Before working at 3PL what was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> I think my favourite job (before 3PL of course) was being a florist. I loved the people and learning about different flowers and what they represent. All of this is in spite of the fact that I have really bad hay fever.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Outside of 3PL, I am a singer in a band. I also am the very proud mum of two kittens, Reggae and Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Engaging, challenging and successful.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> The people, hands down the people. Spending every day, sometimes in high-pressure situations, with the same people and having the ability to go home laughing and smiling really does set 3PL above the rest.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What do you think creates a great customer experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Building not only a professional but personal relationship with the customers who we speak with daily. I often find that by the end of a phone call with one of our customers, we are so far from work topics that I am sure the others in the office wonder what I am actually up to on a daily basis. It makes them feel <strong><em>valued, listened</em> </strong>to and<strong> <em>respected.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>BR: What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AB:</strong> Be yourself. As daunting as it may be coming into such a busy environment, be yourself. You will soon find that every person has a specific role to play in the dynamic here and establishing that from the get-go is an absolute must.</p>

<p>So far, you’ve met <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-john-scully-business-development-manager/" rel="">John Scully</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-brandon-vaughan-it-apprentice/">Brandon Vaughan</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-hannah-banks-customer-support/">Hannah Banks</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-kath-knowles-value-added-services-manager/">Kath Knowles</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-rebecca-whalley-finance-admin-manager/" rel="">Rebecca Whalley,</a> <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-leon-parkinson-continuous-improvement-manager/" rel="">Leon Parkinson </a>and <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-tony-barnes-warehouse-manager/" rel="">Tony Barnes.</a></p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m very excited to introduce you to <strong>Linda Ashton, </strong>HR Manager. Linda is the first HR Manager in the companies history and has played a huge role in developing and shaping our company culture and ensuring we are the #1 place to work within the logistics industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet Linda? Let’s go<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan: To start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at 3PL. What are you responsible for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Linda Ashton:</strong> As the HR Manager for 3PL, I am responsible for the people side of the business, which includes everything involved in the employee life cycle from when a colleague <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/careers/" rel="">joins the Company</a> until they leave, and anything they encounter from an employment perspective along the way. In addition to this, I am responsible for putting strategies in place to ensure we get the best out of our colleagues and are adequately equipped to support and advise the management team with helping us achieve this. Improving staff engagement, reward &amp; recognition, training and communication are also high on my agenda and will form a large part of the initiatives included in the people plan for 2021/22.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to get into HR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> I wanted to work with people and enjoyed getting involved in strategies that help a Company achieve their goals through their most valuable resource, which to me is their people.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> I was keen to work in a logistical warehouse environment, as it was not a business area I had worked in before and given changes in people’s shopping habits, especially with the pandemic, I felt it was a growing and safe business area to work in.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s been your favourite project to work on at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> I have thoroughly enjoyed doing the 1-2-1 with all the staff, as this has given me a fantastic insight into how the operational side of the business works and the frustrations and stumbling blocks colleagues face on a day-to-day basis. This project has also enabled me to get to know staff on a more personal level, whereby I now really feel part of the team and hope that the colleagues feel able to approach me with any future issues, suggestions or feedback they may have. I am really excited about finalising and sharing with the team all the feedback collated from their 1-2-1 sessions and seeing the difference this will make to things such as the way we work, communication, reward &amp; recognition, staff engagement, training, the culture of the business and how all these areas will be an integral part of the people plan.</p>
<p><strong>BR: Before working at 3PL what was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> I was part of a cultural change team for Cheshire police, which was quite literally an impossible task!</p>
<p><strong>BR: What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> I was once on a TV advert for the gym Total Fitness. However, it was so long ago that believe it or not I actually qualified to be in the “young and trendy” membership target group.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> Fast-paced, evolving and challenging</p>
<p><strong>BR: What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> The people make it great and the commitment and loyalty they show to their work.</p>
<p><strong>BR: What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LA:</strong> It is not for the faint-hearted, as it is fast-paced and full-on, but it is great as there is never a dull moment.</p>

<p>It’s time for the latest edition of Inside 3PL.</p>
<p>In this edition, we get to introduce you to another 3PL superstar.</p>
<p>So far, you’ve met <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-john-scully-business-development-manager/" rel="">John Scully</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-brandon-vaughan-it-apprentice/">Brandon Vaughan</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-hannah-banks-customer-support/">Hannah Banks</a>, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-kath-knowles-value-added-services-manager/">Kath Knowles</a> and <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-rebecca-whalley-finance-admin-manager/" rel="">Rebecca Whalley</a></p>
<p>In this month’s edition of Inside 3PL, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our Continuous Improvement Manager and one of our longest serving team members Leon Parkinson. He plays a crucial role here at 3PL, always looking for ways to level up our technologies and systems and supercharge our customer experience at multiple touchpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet Leon? Let’s do this <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan:</strong> To start, can you tell me a little bit about what a Continuous Improvement Manager does?</p>
<p><strong>Leon Parkinson:</strong> I look for ways to improve all aspects of the use of technology across the business from developing our customer-facing <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">cloud-based order fulfilment platform</a> “Fusion” to designing and implementing processes within our warehouse environments.</p>
<p>Essentially, I’m tasked with looking for ways we can enhance our customer&#8217;s experience and our processes across 3PL. Sometimes it’s the little things that can actually make the biggest impact.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Why did you decide to join 3PL?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> I joined 3PL almost 10 years ago, having historically worked in a courier parcel delivery industry my skills were transferrable to the early steps within supply chain. Working for an early-stage business that was growing really excited me. I felt that I had the opportunity to have my ideas heard and also get the opportunities to grow and develop as the business did &#8211; that’s exactly what happened. I’ve had various roles across the business and each one has played a part in helping me to get a deeper understanding of how to better serve our customers.</p>
<p>Even though I mainly work across our technologies, I’m still a firm believer that we ALL work in customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What does your day to day typically look like?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> No day is the same for me here at 3PL, one day I may be reviewing our new business processes. The next day I may be looking at how we can improve our tracking ability on parcels. I’m constantly looking for opportunities for innovation. It keeps it fresh and exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What’s your favourite thing about working at 3PL?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> The variety, our customers are all so unique in their own way and they all need a certain level of white-glove treatment to ensure they are getting the best service from 3PL. Working with technology means that you can never sit still, you have to always find a way to do things better, faster and with greater efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> Can you tell our readers about how the order fulfilment and logistics industry has changed during your time at 3PL?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> Technology has transformed the industry. When joining 3PL 9 years ago the team would manually key every order address into the carriers’ systems, Inbound operators would manually write down inbound receipts on to paper. We have invested heavily in our own technology, meaning that we use the latest barcoding software and implement automation into as many processes as we can with the aim of improving service delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What’s a fun fact about you?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> I once woke up on a pedalo with 5 strangers in the Ionian Sea. (I’ll leave what happened next up to your imagine)</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What’s been your personal career highlight working at 3PL?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> Launching 3PL Fusion. To see the impact this has had for our customers and the growth they have had as a direct result of our own technology, built from scratch has been Incredible. I’m very proud of the work we’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What makes 3PL a great company work for?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> It doesn’t matter what your job role or title is, everyone has the opportunity to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</p>
<p><strong>Leon:</strong> Give 100% effort and you will be successful.</p>

<p>In this edition of Inside 3PL, I am super excited to introduce you to Rebecca Whalley Rebecca is Finance and Admin Manager at our HQ in Wigan. Rebecca began life at 3PL as an apprentice and since then she has never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet Rebecca? Keep scrolling <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Barry Ryan: To start, can you tell me a little bit about your background what you do at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Whalley:</strong> Started as an apprentice 9 years ago and now I’m the Finance &amp; Admin Manager. I create and send customers invoices and also deal with supplier invoices. I do the payroll for the company and maintain the annualised hours tracker. I deal with finance such as Cash Flow, Bank recs, journals, making payments, credit control etc.</p>
<p>Lots of important work that goes on behind the scenes at 3PL</p>
<p><strong>Barry: Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Initially, I wanted to start an apprenticeship to gain experience in a work environment and seeing the 3PL vacancy for Finance and Admin Apprentice stood out to me. I researched the company and really liked the sound of what 3PL did, the customers they worked with the passion for delivering excellent customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Barry: What does your day to day typically look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Audits on transactions (sales &amp; purchases), raising invoices, paying bills, chasing money, checking employee hours – it’s the crucial nuts and bolts work that goes on behind the scenes but really important for the business to run smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Barry: What’s your favourite thing about working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Firstly, it has to be the people. We have a really good group of genuinely good people that do great work every day. Secondly, it’s opportunities that arise. The business has experienced huge growth over the past few years with investment in a new Regional Distribution Centre and order fulfilment technologies and this has created lots of opportunities for everyone to progress their career, just like me!</p>
<p><strong>Barry: Can you tell our readers about how the order fulfilment and logistics industry has changed in your time with 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The general awareness of the industry as a whole has exploded to the wider public. When I first started at 3PL it was hard to explain to people what we did but now everyone understands <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/how-it-works/">eCommerce order fulfilment</a> as they just say, ‘like amazon’. The demand for our services has never been greater.</p>
<p><strong>Barry: What’s been your personal career highlight working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> My proudest moment has to be starting out as an apprentice and then progressing to Finance &amp; Admin Manager. It has been an incredible journey and goes to show that hard work will pay off.</p>
<p><strong>Barry: What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The support and training that is given, I had great support throughout my apprenticeship and even after I passed that 3PL put me on more courses to gain more knowledge that I could apply to my role. You also absorb lots of information from just being around other 3PL managers.</p>
<p><strong>Barry: What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong> Just go for! Give 100% commitment and passion to your role and you can have a great career at 3PL.</p>
