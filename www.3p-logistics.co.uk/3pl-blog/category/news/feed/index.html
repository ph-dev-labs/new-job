										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EGLO, one of the world&#8217;s leading lighting solutions providers, has partnered with 3PL to extend its UK presence by investing in UK domestic distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EGLO is known for their high-quality lighting products that are both stylish and functional and have successfully established its markets across the world with more than 94 subsidiaries on all continents.

Additionally, their product range includes modern and classical outdoor lighting, as well as decorative solar, illuminants, and Smart Home products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership will enhance the company’s D2C and B2B fulfilment strategy by leveraging 3PL’s in-house expertise and industry-leading technology to deliver a seamless shopping experience for customers, whether they choose to shop online, in-store or a combination of both. With 3PL’s </span><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/omnichannel-fulfilment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">omnichannel fulfilment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capabilities, EGLO products will be delivered quickly and efficiently to customers across the UK.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Szreider, Operations Manager at EGLO said: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since moving our UK supply to 3PL in March 2023 for our UK fulfilment, we have seen excellent service from start to finish. From IT integrations to getting the products on the shelf and supplied out to our customer base, the service has been exemplary.  The added benefit of their Fusion system, allowing for real-time tracking of orders through the process, we are confident that 3PL will help us go from strength to strength going forward.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Taylor, Business Development Manager at 3PL commented: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s fantastic to be working with EGLO in supporting Ben and the wider team in transitioning their operations. New business onboarding is so much easier when clear communication and accurate information are supplied in advance and the EGLO team have been amazing in doing just that. From first contact only months ago to outbound operations now realised the setup and go live has been seamless and we now look forward with anticipation to a long and mutually fruitful alliance” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span class="s3">The </span><span class="s3">secret is out and we can’t wait to share the news </span></h2>
<p><span class="s4">Over at 3PL Towers, our creative Labs have been in overdrive of late in mapping out the future for the secret of our success </span><span class="s4">otherwise known as </span><span class="s5">OUR PEOPLE</span><span class="s4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Following</span><span class="s4"> an </span><span class="s4">internal launch in early April, w</span><span class="s4">e’re</span><span class="s4"> delighted to </span><span class="s4">share with our community a brief </span><span class="s4">insight into our newly created </span><span class="s4">People Plan</span><span class="s4">. The plan has </span><span class="s4">4</span><span class="s4"> simple</span><span class="s4"> drivers</span><span class="s4"> that when combined make for a </span><span class="s4">game-changing proposition.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our </span><span class="s5">Vision</span></strong></em><span class="s5"> – </span><span class="s4">To attract, retain, develop and reward “Top Talent”</span></p>
<p><span class="s5"><em><strong>Our Ethos</strong></em> – </span><span class="s4">Everyone deserves a chance to shine</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our Pledge</span></strong></em><span class="s4"> – To create a culture of learning and development </span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our Program</span></strong></em><span class="s4"> – From “Rookie to Rockstar” </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">There’s immense pride in supporting colleagues in taking their talents and careers to the next level and we’re buzzing with excitement. The future trail blazers are potentially within our ranks and our competency-based program is attuned to identify such talent early on in the assessment process. </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Our carefully designed development program is designed to take colleagues on a learning journey with 3PL and help them fulfil their true potential in progressing through the three stages of Rookie, Rising Star and Rockstar at each and every level in the business from entry-level staff </span><span class="s4">through to Senior Management. </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Rosie Currie, HR Manager at </span><span class="s4">3PL </span><span class="s4">added: </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">“</span><span class="s4">The truth about career progression is that there’s a dying opportunity for emerging talent to demonstrate their potential with a growing number of employers seeking to recruit “oven ready” talent directly into the business as opposed to &#8220;growing their own”. At 3PL we seek to adopt a more blended mix of new recruits fused alongside progressive colleagues.</span><span class="s4">” </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">“</span><span class="s4">With our unique <em>Rookie to Rockstar</em> competency program y</span><span class="s4">ou get to fly your own plane, sail your own ship, walk your own walk</span><span class="s4"> and we simply create the progression doors for our colleagues to walk through for those colleagues that have the vision to do so. At 3PL we carry a simple belief that the limiting factor is the </span><span class="s4">mindset of the individual and never the employer and working hard to ensure progressive mindsets exist throughout our organisation.” </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="s5">More learning </span><span class="s5">/ </span><span class="s5">more pay </span><span class="s5">/ </span><span class="s5">more prospects – what’s not to like</span><span class="s5">? </span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In support of its continued expansion <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/omnichannel-fulfilment/">omnichannel fulfilment</a> specialist 3PL has announced the revamp of its Senior Management Team across the verticals of Technical Support, Human Resources, Operations Delivery and Customer Success.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hailed internally as the “Fantastic Four” all posts have been fulfilled through internal promotions awarded to Leon Parkinson, Rosie Currie, Steve Rigby, and Dan Wood. Their new roles will be effective February 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives me immense satisfaction in congratulating everyone on their promotion to the newly reformed SMT. This exciting restructure is specifically designed to further complement and support of the Main Board in expressing our future expansion plans. They are an outstanding group of people with exceptional talent, skill, and experience, who embody the very DNA of our business,” said Founder &amp; MD Ian Walker. “This is the largest ever collective promotion in our history, reflecting our continued commitment to invest in the future of our people, whilst demonstrating the confidence we have about the future growth opportunities that lie ahead. This collective appointment is a fitting testament to their valued contribution to date and their enthusiastic outlook.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As 2023 marks another milestone anniversary in sales growth, the newly formed SMT represents the next generation of diverse management who will continue reinforcing 3PL as a &#8216;best in class&#8217; valued outsourced service provider. The decision to promote all four roles internally underlines the strength and depth within our business, and will undoubtedly have a positive everyday impact on both our customers and colleagues alike.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pointing to the broader sector and the company&#8217;s ongoing growth, FD David Holland echoed the praise, noting that the promotions support expansion in key areas of the business aligned to meet future demand. “The creation of four new senior “impact” roles is designed to complement the current Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and reflects the significant demand we are seeing from the Retail sector in both existing customer growth and the attraction of new business.  Our newly promoted talent has each made a vital contribution to the success of the business to date and I applaud them all on achieving this important career milestone”.</p>
