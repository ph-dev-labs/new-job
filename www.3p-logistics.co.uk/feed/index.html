<p><span class="s4">Over at 3PL Towers, our creative Labs have been in overdrive of late in mapping out the future for the secret of our success </span><span class="s4">otherwise known as </span><span class="s5">OUR PEOPLE</span><span class="s4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Following</span><span class="s4"> an </span><span class="s4">internal launch in early April, w</span><span class="s4">e’re</span><span class="s4"> delighted to </span><span class="s4">share with our community a brief </span><span class="s4">insight into our newly created </span><span class="s4">People Plan</span><span class="s4">. The plan has </span><span class="s4">4</span><span class="s4"> simple</span><span class="s4"> drivers</span><span class="s4"> that when combined make for a </span><span class="s4">game-changing proposition.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our </span><span class="s5">Vision</span></strong></em><span class="s5"> – </span><span class="s4">To attract, retain, develop and reward “Top Talent”</span></p>
<p><span class="s5"><em><strong>Our Ethos</strong></em> – </span><span class="s4">Everyone deserves a chance to shine</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our Pledge</span></strong></em><span class="s4"> – To create a culture of learning and development </span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class="s5">Our Program</span></strong></em><span class="s4"> – From “Rookie to Rockstar” </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">There’s immense pride in supporting colleagues in taking their talents and careers to the next level and we’re buzzing with excitement. The future trail blazers are potentially within our ranks and our competency-based program is attuned to identify such talent early on in the assessment process. </span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Our carefully designed development program is designed to take colleagues on a learning journey with 3PL and help them fulfil their true potential in progressing through the three stages of Rookie, Rising Star and Rockstar at each and every level in the business from entry-level staff </span><span class="s4">through to Senior Management. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an ecommerce business owner, you likely spend a significant amount of time analysing your store&#8217;s metrics, such as conversion rate, bounce rate, and revenue. However, one metric that is often overlooked but holds significant importance is the average order value (AOV). In this guide, we will explain what AOV is, how to calculate it, and how to increase it to maximise your ecommerce revenue.</p>
<h2>Understanding Average Order Value (AOV) and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>AOV is the average amount of money a customer spends on your website per order. AOV is an essential metric for ecommerce businesses because it directly impacts the bottom line. By increasing the AOV, you can generate more revenue without necessarily increasing the number of orders or traffic to your website. This means you can maximize your revenue without incurring additional marketing or acquisition costs.</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Your Store&#8217;s AOV</h2>
<p>To calculate your store&#8217;s AOV, you need to divide the total revenue generated by the number of orders. You can find this information in your ecommerce platform&#8217;s analytics or by exporting a sales report. For example, if your store generated £20,000 in revenue from 200 orders, your AOV would be £100. It&#8217;s important to calculate your AOV regularly and track changes over time. This will help you identify trends and adjust your strategies accordingly.</p>
<h2>How AOV Impacts Business Decisions</h2>
<p>Raising your average order value (AOV) offers more benefits than just boosting your revenue. It can also enhance the efficiency of your entire business.</p>
<p>By gaining deeper insights into your customers and boosting your conversion rates, you can optimise your advertising budget and implement a more beneficial pricing strategy for both you and your clients. AOV serves as a critical indicator of overall business performance, and it can be a valuable tool to increase cash flow in other areas of the business, thereby boosting overall revenue.</p>
<h3>Marketing Strategies</h3>
<p>By knowing your AOV, you can determine how much you can afford to spend on customer acquisition. For example, if your AOV is £100, and you spend £50 on advertising to acquire a customer, you will need to generate two orders to break even.</p>
<h3>Inventory Management</h3>
<p>AOV can also help you manage your inventory. By analysing which products are frequently purchased together, you can bundle them and increase AOV.</p>
<h3>Pricing strategy</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take your store&#8217;s AOV into account when making changes to your pricing strategy. If you see an increase in AOV and maintain or improve your return on investment (ROI) after adjusting your prices, then you&#8217;re on the right track. Although some brands are hesitant to raise prices out of fear that it will reduce conversion rates and turn off customers, the impact of price changes can vary depending on how your brand is perceived by consumers. Some brands are seen as luxury brands, while others are known for offering discounts. Finding the right balance can be challenging and may raise concerns about profit margins.</p>
<h2>What Impacts Your Store&#8217;s AOV?</h2>
<p>Several factors can impact your store&#8217;s AOV, including:</p>
<h3>Product Selection</h3>
<p>The selection of products you offer also impacts your AOV. If you only offer low-priced items, customers may not see the value in purchasing multiple products, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering higher-priced items or product bundles can encourage customers to spend more, resulting in a higher AOV. Additionally, offering a variety of products that appeal to different customer needs and preferences can increase the likelihood of customers purchasing more items.</p>
<h3>Website Design</h3>
<p>The design and layout of your website can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. A poorly designed website can be confusing and frustrating for customers, leading to a lower AOV. A well-designed website that is easy to navigate, with clear product descriptions and images, can encourage customers to spend more time browsing and ultimately lead to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering personalised product recommendations and easy-to-use search and filter options can help customers find products they are interested in and increase the likelihood of purchasing more items.</p>
<h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
<p>The cost of shipping can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. High shipping costs can discourage customers from purchasing multiple items, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering free shipping for orders above a certain threshold can encourage customers to purchase more items to reach that threshold, leading to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering fast and reliable shipping options can increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases, ultimately resulting in a higher AOV.</p>
<h3>Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
<p>If you offer products on a subscription basis and enjoy recurring revenue, along with a solid strategy for retaining repeat customers, you&#8217;re in a great position. This means that you can have a lower average order value (AOV) and allocate more resources towards customer acquisition than brands lacking these features.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: your customer lifetime value is higher than that of brands selling only one product or without a retention strategy. By forecasting that over half of your customers will make repeat purchases or subscribe to a recurring revenue-generating service, you can compute the average lifetime value, which determines the lifetime AOV.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you sell a £10 monthly subscription, and most subscribers stick around for 15 months. In that case, you have a lifetime value of £150, even if your AOV is just £10. This means you can spend more than £10 to acquire a customer, knowing that you can earn an average of £150 from that customer over their time with your brand.</p>
<h3>Product Pricing</h3>
<p>The price of your products has a direct impact on your store&#8217;s average order value (AOV). If your prices are too high, customers may not be willing to purchase as much, resulting in a lower AOV. On the other hand, if your prices are too low, customers may not feel the need to purchase additional items, leading to a lower AOV. Finding the right balance is crucial to increasing your AOV. Consider implementing product bundling or offering discounts for purchasing multiple items to encourage customers to spend more.</p>
<p>It may still be worth considering adjusting your pricing strategy to see if you can cover your cost per conversion.</p>
<p>For instance, increasing your subscription price from £10 to £12 may not significantly impact your conversion rate, but it can generate an additional £24 per customer per year, which could cover your acquisition costs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure that your return on ad spend (ROAS), which is the ratio of cost per conversion to customer lifetime value (CPC:LTV), remains net positive, and the higher the ROAS, the better. Improving your AOV can be an effective method to boost your ROAS because it relies on increasing the amount customers spend during checkout instead of attracting more customers, which can be costly.</p>
<h2>6 Tips to Increase Your Store&#8217;s AOV</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Upselling and cross-selling techniques:</strong> Upselling and cross-selling techniques involve suggesting complementary or higher-priced items to customers. For example, if a customer is purchasing a camera, you could recommend a higher-end model or suggest additional lenses or accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Bundling products:</strong> Bundling products involves grouping complementary items together and offering them at a discounted price. This can encourage customers to purchase multiple items and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Offering free shipping and other incentives:</strong> Offering free shipping or other incentives, such as a free gift with purchase, can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a minimum order value for free shipping:</strong> Offer free shipping for orders over a specific amount. This motivates customers to add more items to their cart to reach the free shipping threshold, thereby increasing the AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Limited-time offers:</strong> Limited-time offers, such as a discount on orders over a certain amount, can encourage customers to purchase more items to take advantage of the offer.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a minimum order value for free shipping:</strong> Offer free shipping for orders over a specific amount. This motivates customers to add more items to their cart to reach the free shipping threshold, thereby increasing the AOV.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s look into some of these points in more detail..</p>
<h2>Upselling and Cross-selling Techniques to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Upselling and cross-selling techniques can be highly effective in increasing AOV. Here are some tips to implement these techniques successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Personalisation:</strong> personalisation is essential in upselling and cross-selling. Use customer data to suggest products that are relevant to their interests and past purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Display recommendations on product pages:</strong> displaying recommendations on product pages can encourage customers to add additional items to their cart.</li>
<li><strong>Use product bundles:</strong> bundling products can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV. For example, if a customer is purchasing a dress, you could suggest matching shoes and accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Offer discounts on bundles:</strong> offering a discount on bundles can make them more appealing to customers and increase AOV.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bundling Products to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Bundling products involves grouping complementary items together and offering them at a discounted price. Here are some tips to bundle products successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose complementary products:</strong> choose products that are often purchased together or are relevant to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Use product images:</strong> use product images to showcase the bundled items and create a visually appealing bundle.</li>
<li><strong>Offer discounts:</strong> offering a discount on bundles can make them more appealing to customers and increase AOV.</li>
<li><strong>Use limited-time offers</strong>: limited-time offers, such as a discount on bundles for a specific period, can create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to purchase.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Offering Free Shipping and Other Incentives to Increase AOV</h2>
<p>Offering free shipping and other incentives can encourage customers to purchase more items and increase AOV. Here are some tips to offer free shipping and other incentives successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use minimum spend thresholds:</strong> use minimum spend thresholds to offer free shipping or other incentives. For example, offer free shipping on orders over £50.</li>
<li><strong>Use limited-time offers:</strong> limited-time offers, such as free shipping for a specific period, can encourage customers to purchase more items to take advantage of the offer.</li>
<li><strong>Use pop-ups and banners:</strong> use pop-ups and banners to promote free shipping or other incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Offer incentives for referrals:</strong> offer incentives, such as a discount on the next order, for customers who refer friends or family to your store.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How a 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) Provider Can Help Increase AOV</h2>
<p>A 3PL  provider can help increase AOV by offering additional services, such as:</p>
<h3>Inventory Management</h3>
<p>One of the primary ways a 3PL provider can help increase AOV is through effective inventory management. By utilising advanced inventory management tools, a 3PL provider can help ecommerce businesses reduce the risk of stockouts and overstocks, which can lead to lost sales and wasted resources. Additionally, by leveraging their expertise and technology, a 3PL provider can optimise inventory levels and ensure that popular products are always in stock, thus increasing the likelihood that customers will add additional items to their cart.</p>
<h3>Shipping and Fulfilment</h3>
<p>Another way a 3PL provider can increase AOV is by providing fast and reliable shipping and fulfilment services. Many consumers are willing to pay more for fast-tracked shipping or choose to add additional items to their cart to reach a free shipping threshold. By partnering with a 3PL provider that offers a range of shipping options and has the ability to quickly process and fulfil orders, ecommerce businesses can increase their AOV by encouraging customers to make larger purchases and feel more confident in their overall shopping experience.</p>
<h3>Returns Management</h3>
<p>Lastly, effective returns management is an often overlooked but critical component of increasing AOV. By working with a 3PL provider that offers streamlined returns processing, ecommerce businesses can provide customers with a hassle-free returns experience, which can increase customer loyalty and encourage repeat purchases. Additionally, a 3PL provider can help identify patterns and reasons for returns, which can inform inventory and product selection decisions, leading to better sales performance and ultimately, increased AOV.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Maximizing Your Ecommerce Revenue Through AOV</h2>
<p>In conclusion, AOV is an essential metric for ecommerce businesses. By increasing AOV, you can generate more revenue without necessarily increasing traffic or marketing costs. To increase AOV, implement upselling and cross-selling techniques, bundle products, offer free shipping and other incentives, and consider working with a 3PL provider. Regularly track your AOV and adjust your strategies to maximize your ecommerce revenue.</p>
<h2>Increase your AOV with 3PL</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Batch and serial number tracking is an essential part of the manufacturing process. This system helps ensure that control is maintained over the production process and that the quality of the products is maintained. In this article, we will look at what batch and serial number tracking is, the differences between batch and serial numbers, the importance of the right technology for batch control, and how 3PL batch and serial number tracking can help you take control of your stock. We will also look at the benefits of batch and serial number tracking and some tips for implementing it.</p>
<h2>What is Batch and Serial Number Tracking?</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking is a process used to identify and track products. This process helps to maintain control over the production process and can be used to ensure the quality of the products. It also helps to identify and trace any problems that may arise in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking involve assigning each product with a unique identifier. This unique identifier is used to track the product from production to sale. It also allows for the tracking of the product&#8217;s history, such as where it was produced, when it was produced, and who produced it. This information can be used to identify any potential problems with the product and to take corrective action.</p>
<h2>What is a Batch Number and how it works?</h2>
<p>A batch number is a unique identifier assigned to a group of products that were manufactured together. It is used to identify and track the products from production to sale. The batch number is typically printed on the product&#8217;s label or packaging.</p>
<p>The batch number can be used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. For example, if a product is found to be defective, the batch number can be used to trace the product back to the production line and determine the cause of the defect.</p>
<p><strong>Batch picking works in 4 steps:</strong></p>
<h3>1. Generate picking lists for each order</h3>
<p>A document called a picking list is used to convey information about the items that must be sent to a customer, such as SKU(s), quantities, and storage location(s) of the inventory.</p>
<p>When orders have the same picking lists, batch picking is the most effective method. This enables the picker to have a queue of orders ready for dispatch to various customers.</p>
<p>Printed lists are uncommon in today&#8217;s world. Instead, wearable devices and technology are utilised in modern warehouses to combine, allocate, and fulfil each order, eliminating the need for paper.</p>
<h3>2. Group orders by common items</h3>
<p>To perform batch picking, orders that have identical items must be combined into a batch. An order management system or a warehouse management system (WMS) can automatically group orders that are batchable and contain the same items and quantities.</p>
<h3>3. Give a batch to a picker</h3>
<p>A warehouse management system (WMS) can create batch pick lists for each picker, optimising the retrieval process of items. However, if done manually, it may be necessary to create an efficient route for each picker to retrieve all the SKUs.</p>
<h3>4. Pick all items in the order</h3>
<p>To avoid wasting time or taking unnecessary steps, each picker must adhere to the picking list and optimise their route to select the correct items. After picking the SKUs for the batch orders, the orders can be passed on to a packer, and the picker can proceed with the next batch.</p>
<h2>The advantages of batch picking</h2>
<h3>1. Less foot travel for employees</h3>
<p>Warehouses can be enormous, and traveling between each section of a warehouse can be time-consuming. If employees must retrieve items from multiple, distant locations, order fulfilment will take longer. Batch picking simplifies operations by allowing workers to complete the same task in bulk, reducing the distance they need to travel and increasing their productivity.</p>
<h3>2. Faster picking rates</h3>
<p>Efficient order fulfilment is a significant factor in the success of warehouse operations. Batch picking can help employees minimize their movement around the warehouse, allowing them to complete their tasks more quickly. By reducing travel time between orders, pickers can process orders more rapidly, decreasing the average time required to fulfil an order.</p>
<h3>3. Reduced costs</h3>
<p>As productivity rises, the amount of manpower required for picking decreases, resulting in minimal overtime and subsequently lowering the expenditure on labour costs.</p>
<h2>What is a Serial Number?</h2>
<p>A serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a single product. It is used to identify and track the product from production to sale. The serial number is typically printed on the product&#8217;s label or packaging.</p>
<p>The serial number can be used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. For example, if a product is found to be defective, the serial number can be used to trace the product back to the production line and determine the cause of the defect.</p>
<h2>What is the Difference between Batch and Serial Numbers?</h2>
<p>The main difference between batch and serial numbers is that batch numbers are assigned to a group of products that were manufactured together, while serial numbers are assigned to a single product. Batch numbers are typically used to track the production process and to identify any potential issues with the product. Serial numbers are typically used to identify and track individual products.</p>
<p>One example of a product that uses batch numbers is cosmetic products. Each batch of cosmetic products produced by a manufacturing company is given a unique batch number, which allows the product to be traced and identified in the event of a recall or quality issue. This helps ensure the safety and quality of the medication being distributed to consumers.</p>
<h2>The Importance of the Right Technology for Batch Control</h2>
<p>The right technology is essential for effective batch control. Technology such as RFID tags and barcode scanners can be used to track and identify products. This technology can help to ensure that the right products are being produced and that any problems are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, software technology can be used to automate the batch and serial number tracking process. This can help to reduce the amount of time and effort required to track and control batches of products. It can also help to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<h2>How Batch and Serial Number Tracking Can Help With Control</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can help to ensure that control is maintained over the production process. It can also help to identify and trace any problems that may arise in the manufacturing process. This can help to ensure that only the highest quality products are produced.</p>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can also help to improve the efficiency of the production process. Tracking the production process can help identify any areas that need improvement and ensure that the production process is running as smoothly as possible.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Batch and Serial Number Tracking</h2>
<p>Batch and serial number tracking can provide many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved control over the production process</li>
<li>Improved product quality</li>
<li>Reduced costs associated with product recalls</li>
<li>Improved efficiency of the production process</li>
<li>Improved traceability of products</li>
<li>Reduced time and effort required to track and control batches of products</li>
</ul>
<h2>3PL Batch and Serial Number Tracking Software Solutions</h2>
<p>There are many software solutions available to help with batch and serial number tracking. These software solutions can help to automate the process and ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date. They can also help to reduce the amount of time and effort required to track and control batches of products.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an award-winning ecommerce fulfilment specialist, we are often asked about the future of ecommerce. With our crystal ball in hand, our most recent blog post takes a predictive look into the future of the UK ecommerce sector for the remainder of 2023.</p>
<p>Here are our top 10 movers and shakers to be alive to:</p>
<p><strong>1. Overall UK ecommerce growth will slow down to pre-pandemic levels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A Year of Survival – particularly for aggregators and resellers with thin margins.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Cost reduction imperatives will drive sellers to invest in technology and business process often outsourcing physical operations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Amazon’s fees and advertising costs will continue to rise – leading many sellers to diversify their sales channels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Bitcoin and other forms of Crypto will start to emerge for online transactions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Growth in DTC e-commerce sites will continue to build momentum. The rising tide will float all DTC boats, but Shopify will be the primary beneficiary.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Liquidation sites will benefit from high inventories and slower ecommerce growth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Container shipping costs will drop as demand levels out and supply chain bottlenecks continue to be resolved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. eBay will do quite well with an increase in re-commerce and the rise in discount shopping.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. More ecommerce sellers and sites will embrace Artificial Intelligence.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever eagerly ordered a product online, only to be filled with disappointment when it arrives damaged? It’s an experience which can damage brand reputations and result in losing loyal customers. <strong><em>If you want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your eCommerce brand, discover the best ways to prevent product damage during shipping now…</em></strong></p>
<h2>The importance of packaging your products correctly</h2>
<p>It may seem like an obvious point, but it’s essential that your products are packaged correctly before they are dispatched to customers.</p>
<p>Damaged products not only cause heartache and dissatisfaction for consumers, but they are a real headache for retailers too &#8211; who often have to absorb the cost of replacing damaged items.</p>
<p>It’s not a minor problem, either. According to research carried out by the Citizens Advice Bureau, approximately two in three people (69 per cent) who shop online have ‘had parcels go missing, damaged or turn up late’.</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by research body Statista in 2019 found that damaged products were in the top five reasons for dissatisfaction with online retailers amongst consumers.</p>
<p>Yet another piece of research from packaging company Sealed Air found that approximately 20% of eCommerce returns can be attributed to damage to the product.</p>
<p>It’s clear, then, that product damage during delivery is not only a widespread issue but a serious one amongst consumers.</p>
<p>So, what can you &#8211; as an eCommerce retailer &#8211; do about it? In the next section of this article, the 3PL team will provide you with their top tips to prevent product damage during shipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to prevent your products from being damaged during shipping</h2>
<p>As you’re about to see, there are a wealth of ways in which you can prevent your products from being damaged during shipping. Some are simpler than others, but they all have one thing in common; they’ll result in fewer damaged products and happier customers!</p>
<h3>1. Use quality packaging</h3>
<p>Packaging is one of those areas where it can be all too tempting to cut costs. However, given the volume of returns that can occur as a result of damage, cheap packaging almost always turns out to be a false economy.</p>
<p>Consider using packaging such as corrugated cardboard boxes, custom folding cartons, or rigid boxes, which will provide an enhanced level of protection beyond that which you would get from cheaper packaging materials such as poly bags.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the correct size packaging</h3>
<p>One of the most common reasons for damage to products during shipping is that they’ve been shipped in the packaging of the incorrect size.</p>
<p>Ideally, the box or packaging you use should only be slightly larger than the product you are shipping. The closer you can align the size of your packaging with your products, the better.</p>
<p>For a great example, think about Apple products. The size of their packaging is so closely aligned with the size of their products that they almost have an ‘airtight’ style seal. This ensures the products are maximally protected during shipping.</p>
<p>Having said that, though, you do need to ensure there is enough room for a decent amount of dunnage (dunnage being the packing materials that help cushion the product in the shipping box).</p>
<h3>3. Wrap your products</h3>
<p>This is an especially important point if your products are fragile, prone to breakage, shattering or being scratched or dented.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of product, you’ll want to use a particular type of dunnage (e.g. wrapping material). For example, if you’re sending items such as ceramic mugs, then you’ll want to ensure they are wrapped in very thick bubble wrap in addition to being held in place with cardboard frames to prevent excessive movement.</p>
<h3>4. Fill all empty space</h3>
<p>When we said earlier that you want to reduce the amount of empty space in your packaging, we meant it!</p>
<p>If you can’t completely eliminate empty space in your packaging (e.g. you’re struggling to find boxes that are a very close fit to your product), then you at least want to fill that empty space with protective material.</p>
<p>Think of those times when you’ve opened a package and &#8211; aside from the product &#8211; the box has been filled with packing peanuts, bubble wrap or packing paper. That’s done deliberately to ensure your product is cushioned and arrives with you in one piece.</p>
<h3>5. Use ‘fragile’ labels</h3>
<p>You can significantly reduce the amount of breakage you experience by adding ‘fragile’ labels to your packages.</p>
<p>Make these fragile labels clear enough, and you’ll be giving couriers a clear indication that they need to take care when handling your deliveries!</p>
<h3>6. Use shock absorbing packaging materials</h3>
<p>If you really want to be confident that your products are going to arrive with your customers in one piece, consider investing in shock absorbing packaging materials.</p>
<p>In recent years, shock absorbing packaging materials have become quite advanced, with available solutions including shock absorbing ‘floors’, die-cut foam inserts, and stabilisation blocks.</p>
<p>These materials can significantly reduce the effects of shock and vibration on your products &#8211; which are the key causes of damage to products during transit.</p>
<h3>7. Do a trial run!</h3>
<p>Before you start sending out hundreds of your products, it’s a very good idea to conduct a series of trial runs.</p>
<p>If you have the time, and the inclination, try conducting several trial runs. Send the same product in different packaging variations to see which packaging configuration has the best results.</p>
<p>Should you just be starting out in the world of eCommerce, and you’re still to decide upon a full-time shipping partner, it can also be worthwhile sending some trial packages with a number of different couriers to see what the results are.</p>
<h3>8. Record damage data</h3>
<p>Make it a point to track and record every single incidence of damage that your customers report to you.</p>
<p>Doing this can help you identify common trends. For example, if products are being consistently damaged in a certain way, it may mean the packaging they are being shipped in, isn’t fit for purpose.</p>
<h3>9. Use a quality shipping partner</h3>
<p>If you want to take the hassle out of fulfilling and shipping your products and focus on what you do best &#8211; marketing and selling your goods &#8211; then working with a quality third-party logistics (3PL) company is more than worthwhile.</p>
<p>Third-party logistics providers such as ourselves here at 3PL can take care of your entire fulfilment process, from managing orders, picking and packing your products, and ensuring they reach your customers quickly and in one piece via the best couriers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking of outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider (3PL) this year? It’s a big move, but one that can provide you with significant cost savings, efficiencies and more. But, only if you pick the right 3PL. <strong><em>Find out how to do exactly that in this guide…</em></strong></p>
<h2>Start by assessing your fulfilment requirements</h2>
<p>Before you start shopping around for 3PLs, you should first take the time to assess your requirements.</p>
<p>This can be as simple as asking yourself a series of questions about how your business currently handles fulfilment.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many orders do you fulfil each day?</li>
<li>What kind of products do you fulfil?</li>
<li>Which platforms do you sell on? How are these integrated into your fulfilment process?</li>
<li>How accurate is your inventory management?</li>
<li>How accurate is your fulfilment process?</li>
<li>Which markets do you sell to? Do these include international locations?</li>
<li>What are your growth plans?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions (and more!) will help you to fully understand what you require from a third-party logistics provider.</p>
<h2>Taking the leap: the benefits of outsourcing your fulfilment</h2>
<p>There’s no getting away from the fact that outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider is a big deal. But, it can also bring <strong>big</strong> benefits.</p>
<p>When making the decision as to whether or not you’ll outsource your fulfilment, you should look ahead and consider some important long-term trends:</p>
<h3>The cost of energy</h3>
<p>Firstly, energy prices are currently sky-high &#8211; and are unlikely to decrease anytime soon. If you’re tempted to keep your fulfilment operations in-house, consider that things like warehousing, delivery and general operations are energy-intensive.</p>
<p>Instead, if you outsource your fulfilment to a third-party logistics provider, you won’t have to incur the high-energy costs associated with fulfilment.</p>
<h3>Rising costs and inflation</h3>
<p>It’s not just energy that’s become a huge burden for eCommerce businesses to bear. Following the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, global supply chains have fractured.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the cost of raw materials rising significantly. This has had the knock-on effect of increasing inflation and labour costs.</p>
<p>By outsourcing your fulfilment in 2023, you can avoid many of these costs as you won’t have to employ an in-house fulfilment team.</p>
<p>These are not the only ways in which outsourcing fulfilment can save your business money. However, they are the most pressing trends facing eCommerce brands.</p>
<p><strong><em>Guide &#8211; to discover more ways outsourcing fulfilment can save you money, </em></strong><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/how-can-outsourcing-to-3pl-help-your-business-cut-costs/"><strong><em>read our complete guide now</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>
<h2>How to select the best 3PL for your business</h2>
<p>As you’ve just read, outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL can have a positive impact on your brand’s profitability, operations, efficiencies and more.</p>
<p><strong><em>But, only if you select the right 3PL. </em></strong>Make the wrong decision and things can go badly wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, to help you select the best 3PL partner for your business, we’ve outlined our top requirements to look for below.</p>
<h3>Omnichannel expertise</h3>
<p>These days, it’s rare for eCommerce brands to restrict their sales and marketing efforts to their website.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise of online marketplaces (e.g., Amazon) and social commerce (e.g., shopfronts on TikTok, Instagram and others), eCommerce retailers can receive orders through myriad channels. In 2023, customers are expecting a seamless shopping experience across all channels.</p>
<p>The thing is, managing those orders from multiple channels can be a challenge.</p>
<p>So, it’s vital that you select a 3PL partner that has a demonstrated track record in managing fulfilment through multiple channels (this is typically called ‘omnichannel fulfilment’).</p>
<p>The very best <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/integrations/">third-party logistics providers</a> have the technology and associated dashboards that allow them to integrate directly with your multiple sales channels &#8211; whether they are Shopify, eBay, Amazon, Magento, or a broad mix of all of them!</p>
<p>If a 3PL can’t demonstrate this ability to integrate into your channels, give them a miss!</p>
<h3>Geographical network</h3>
<p>Another important point to consider when choosing a 3PL partner is whether they have an international network of warehouses and distribution points.</p>
<p>All too often, 3PLs will state that they have an international network, when the reality is they simply outsource these operations themselves.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/locations/">we have our own international warehouse and distribution locations</a> in the UK, the USA, China, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>With dedicated in-country warehousing, a 3PL will be able to keep your products stocked locally, making it quicker and easier to make and fulfil sales in those locations. Having international warehouse locations will also reduce your overall shipping costs and shipping times &#8211; meaning you can truly accelerate your growth in global markets.</p>
<h3>Customer service</h3>
<p>Don’t run the risk of just becoming a number! When selecting a 3PL partner for your fulfilment, you should select one that puts customer service at the top of their priorities.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, outsourcing your fulfilment is a big move. You’re handing control of your stock and fulfilment to a third party, after all. So, you want to choose a 3PL that’s going to be responsive and helpful to your queries.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, we provide a personal touch with every client being assigned their own account manager. This account manager acts as your point of contact and ensures that any queries you have are quickly answered.</p>
<p>This isn’t the case with other 3PLs, where you won’t receive a personalised, personal service.</p>
<p>What’s more, here at 3PL we also provide our customers with our <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fusion-platform/">Fusion portal</a>, which provides them with on-demand access to their information 24/7 from anywhere in the world. At a glance, our customers can see the state of their inventory, orders and more.</p>
<p>It’s for these reasons that many of the fastest-growing eCommerce brands are <u>selecting</u><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/case-studies/"> 3PL</a> for their fulfilment.</p>
<h3>Specialised fulfilment services</h3>
<p>Whilst it may be tempting to think of fulfilment as a generic service, it really isn’t. So, when you’re selecting a third-party logistics provider, we suggest selecting one that truly understands eCommerce.</p>
<p>That’s because eCommerce &#8211; like other forms of retail &#8211; has nuances and details that can impact the fulfilment process in various ways.</p>
<p>Here at 3PL, we understand eCommerce and know that certain products have specialist fulfilment requirements. That’s why we offer niche, specialist fulfilment for products such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/supplement-vitamin-fulfilment-services/">Supplement and vitamin fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/beauty-cosmetics-fulfilment-services/">Beauty and cosmetics fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/fashion-fulfilment-services/">Fashion fulfilment</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/electronics-fulfilment/">Electronics fulfilment</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t choose a generic 3PL. Choose one that understands your products and their specialist fulfilment requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/category/inside-3pl/">Inside 3PL</a>, where we introduce you to the amazingly talented people that make 3PL such a fantastic place to work.</p>
<p>Today, it gives us great pleasure to introduce you to James Taylor<strong>, </strong>a Business Development Manager, who is responsible for identifying new business opportunities and building relationships with clients and partners.</p>
<p><strong>Ready to meet James? Let’s do it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To start, can you tell us a little bit about your background and what you do at 3PL? </strong><strong>What are you responsible for? </strong></p>
<p><strong>James Taylor (JT): </strong>I have worked within the recruitment industry for the past 10 years +. During this time, I specialised in the industrial sector, making the transition to 3PL much smoother. At 3PL my role as Business Development Manager has me focusing primarily on bringing new business onboard. As part of this, ensuring a quality introduction for new companies, working closely with our customer service team to ensure the needs of the customer are prioritised and working with those customers to enhance the growth of their businesses and elevate them to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to get into your current job role? </strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I love to meet and speak to people but also love the idea of a complex sell. It became apparent that the complexity of third-party logistics was a real interest. Working with businesses to provide solutions that will realise their growth potential is a real buzz for me.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> 3PL is a driven, professional business with a homely/community feel. With honesty and integrity at the forefront, it is an environment where everyone can be part of a great team and achieve their true potential.</p>
<p><strong>What does your day-to-day typically look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Woking with <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/3pl-blog/inside-3pl-meet-john-scully-business-development-manager/">John</a>, I look to establish companies that are embarking on exponential growth which will see our services and solutions help transition their businesses to the next level. In addition to this, we look to highlight more established businesses that would use our services to relieve stress/pressure in other areas of their business, allowing them to grow organically.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite thing about working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> 3PL is a great work environment where the collective team has a common goal in ensuring customers’ expectations are exceeded. The future growth of our customers and the success of the business overall provide us with the daily motivation to succeed. Both elements form the 3PL DNA and it’s really refreshing to see and to be part of something special.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell our readers about how the order fulfilment and logistics industry has changed over the past years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> This industry has moved with the customer. Its flexibility has seen the solutions we provide mould into different guises which work to suit the solution that the customer requires. To stand still in this industry renders your relevance mute. Technology has played a huge part in this transformation. Technological advances have made the possibilities almost endless and timescales reduce out of recognition.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a fun fact about you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> During my early 20’s I spent 7 months in Australia playing cricket.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been your personal career highlight working at 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Meeting the team. Fantastic, driven team all working to continue to grow the business.</p>
<p><strong>What three words describe 3PL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Driven, Professional, Team</p>
<p><strong>What makes 3PL a great company to work for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> The people</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for prospective 3PL candidates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JT: </strong>Come and enjoy it! Very welcoming environment so the usual nerves that surround starting a new role are not required.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In support of its continued expansion <a href="https://www.3p-logistics.co.uk/omnichannel-fulfilment/">omnichannel fulfilment</a> specialist 3PL has announced the revamp of its Senior Management Team across the verticals of Technical Support, Human Resources, Operations Delivery and Customer Success.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hailed internally as the “Fantastic Four” all posts have been fulfilled through internal promotions awarded to Leon Parkinson, Rosie Currie, Steve Rigby, and Dan Wood. Their new roles will be effective February 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives me immense satisfaction in congratulating everyone on their promotion to the newly reformed SMT. This exciting restructure is specifically designed to further complement and support of the Main Board in expressing our future expansion plans. They are an outstanding group of people with exceptional talent, skill, and experience, who embody the very DNA of our business,” said Founder &amp; MD Ian Walker. “This is the largest ever collective promotion in our history, reflecting our continued commitment to invest in the future of our people, whilst demonstrating the confidence we have about the future growth opportunities that lie ahead. This collective appointment is a fitting testament to their valued contribution to date and their enthusiastic outlook.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As 2023 marks another milestone anniversary in sales growth, the newly formed SMT represents the next generation of diverse management who will continue reinforcing 3PL as a &#8216;best in class&#8217; valued outsourced service provider. The decision to promote all four roles internally underlines the strength and depth within our business, and will undoubtedly have a positive everyday impact on both our customers and colleagues alike.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pointing to the broader sector and the company&#8217;s ongoing growth, FD David Holland echoed the praise, noting that the promotions support expansion in key areas of the business aligned to meet future demand. “The creation of four new senior “impact” roles is designed to complement the current Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and reflects the significant demand we are seeing from the Retail sector in both existing customer growth and the attraction of new business.  Our newly promoted talent has each made a vital contribution to the success of the business to date and I applaud them all on achieving this important career milestone”.</p>
