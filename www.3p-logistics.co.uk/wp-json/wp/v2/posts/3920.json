But perhaps you\u2019re wondering what exactly it is? And, why is it used? If you want the answers to those questions and more, then keep reading\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Delivered duty paid definition<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s begin by defining what DDP actually is. Delivered duty paid (also referred to as delivery duty paid), is a type of shipping whereby the seller (i.e. you or the freight company that you choose) takes responsibility for all of the fees and risks associated with shipping an item.<\/p>\n<p>DDP is what\u2019s known as an \u2018Incoterm\u2019, which is a pre-defined commercial term which was developed by the International Chamber of Commerce in order to help standardise shipping options when you\u2019re shipping something from one country to another.<\/p>\n<p>Under the terms of DDP, a seller must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take all responsibility for the shipping of a good until it reaches the agreed-upon destination.<\/li>\n<li>Take responsibility for arranging all shipping as well as the costs associated with export clearance and customs documentation.<\/li>\n<li>Take responsibility for VAT charges and any costs associated with delays etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Because of the additional work that is associated with DDP shipments compared to other types of shipment, it\u2019s mainly used for higher-value items and goods (typically \u00a325 or higher).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why is DDP used?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ve just read, there\u2019s quite a lot for a seller to do under the terms of DDP. But, there are many good reasons why it does get used.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It protects your customers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>DDP shipments ensure that the people buying your goods in other countries won\u2019t suddenly find themselves with some nasty surprises (like having to pay a customs charge on top of what they\u2019ve already paid for the item).<\/p>\n<p>Using DDP also provides your overseas customers with reassurance. Because DDP is an internationally-recognised form of shipping agreement, your customers will be confident that they\u2019ll actually receive the item(s) they\u2019ve ordered.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It ensures safe delivery<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a consumer and you\u2019re thinking about ordering something from another country, you may be a little worried if it will actually reach you in one piece or not.<\/p>\n<p>With DDP that worry is erased. It\u2019s up to the seller to ensure that the item they are shipping &#8211; be it by air or sea &#8211; arrives in perfect condition. If the item does turn up damaged, then it\u2019s the sellers responsibility to rectify the situation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It provides a smooth buying experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>From a consumer\u2019s perspective, the less they have to do, the better.<\/p>\n<p>Say someone wants a coat that they\u2019ve spotted online. They want to be able to click \u2018add to basket\u2019 and have it arrive at their doorstep sometime later.<\/p>\n<p>What they <strong><u>don\u2019t want<\/u><\/strong> is to have to go to the post office and pay an exorbitantly expensive customs fee or import duty. Not only are extra charges a sting, but the fact that a customer has to make a trip to a post office or depot, and also experience a delay in receiving their item makes the whole experience a sour one.<\/p>\n<p>DDP ensures the types of things we\u2019ve just described don&#8217;t happen. In other words, DDP makes buying something from an international eCommerce store a much smoother and pleasant experience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The advantages of delivery duty paid<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve just seen, there are plenty of good reasons why DDP is used. It will certainly help you to reassure international customers and provide them with a smooth, stress-free buying experience.<\/p>\n<p>But, what are the other advantages of DDP? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lower risk<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you decide to send your goods using DDP, then the company that is in charge of your freight is responsible for ensuring that your item is sent safely, securely and that all associated customs, VAT and other charges are paid for.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Internationally recognised<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Because DDP is an Incoterm, it sets out very clear rules and responsibilities. Whilst there are quite a few things that need to be done under a DDP shipping arrangement, the fact that there <em>are actually<\/em> set rules and responsibilities will make your life as a seller easier.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way; if everyone (that is, freight companies, port authorities, customs officers etc) has set rules that they have to follow, then there\u2019s less chance that something will go wrong with the shipping of your orders.<\/p>\n<p>In short, whilst DDP may be a bit more onerous than other types of shipping arrangement, it conversely will make your international shipping <em>easier<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Accurate pricing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>By choosing a DDP shipping solution with a reputable freight provider, you\u2019ll have a single, clear price to pay for the shipping of your orders.<\/p>\n<p>Quality DDP shipping providers will typically offer complete packages that take into account not only the cost of shipping, but also the associated customs and tax charges that will be levied on your orders.<\/p>\n<p>This will make your life much easier than if you were to try other types of international shipping where you can be hit with unexpected (and large!) fees.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The disadvantages of delivery duty paid<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Whilst DDP does certainly make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/a-guide-to-international-shipping-for-ecommerce-stores\/\">international shipping<\/a> easier for eCommerce brands, it isn\u2019t without its downsides.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Cost<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Without a doubt, DDP can be more expensive than other forms of international shipping.<\/p>\n<p>The reason is largely down to the fact that you, as the seller, are assuming responsibility for not only the cost of shipping, but also any associated taxes and duties that need to be paid.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst you can factor these costs into the pricing of your products, this may well make your pricing uncompetitive.<\/p>\n<p>The alternative is to use other forms of international shipping where more responsibility is placed on the buyer. As you\u2019d expect however, this can be less appealing to consumers who may not want the hassle of having to pay customs duties etc.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Complexity<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The fact is, DDP involves more work for sellers (or the freight companies they choose).<\/p>\n<p>As you are responsible for shipping and paying applicable fees, taxes and duties, there\u2019s multiple bits of paperwork that needs to be completed. There\u2019s also the job of communication; it\u2019s your responsibility to keep the buyer informed of things like delays.<\/p>\n<p>So, DDP can be more burdensome than other types of international shipping.<\/p>\n<h2>Want someone to handle international shipping for you?<\/h2>\n<p>Having just read all of that, you may be wondering if offering international shipping on your eCommerce store is actually worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, the answer is that you can take away much of the worry and work by selecting someone to handle your international shipping for you.<\/p>\n<p>That someone is 3PL!<\/p>\n<p>We work with eCommerce brands big and small and have extensive experience providing international fulfilment and shipping.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/get-started\/\">Speak to 3PL<\/a> about your international shipping requirements today<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For more eCommerce logistics, fulfilment and shipping advice, read the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/\"><strong>3PL blog<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-is-3pl-a-guide-to-what-third-party-logistics-companies-do\/\"><strong>What Is 3PL: A Guide to What Third Party Logistics Companies Do<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/why-international-shipping-rates-are-so-high-and-what-this-means-for-ecommerce-stores\/\"><strong>Why International Shipping Rates Are so High and What This Means for eCommerce Stores<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/how-to-put-together-an-effective-supply-chain-logistics-strategy\/\"><strong>How to Put Together an Effective Supply Chain &amp; Logistics Strategy<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3922,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"wds_primary_category":0},"categories":[10],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3920"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3920"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3920\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3923,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3920\/revisions\/3923"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3922"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3920"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3920"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3920"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
