But, before you go and sign up, there\u2019s one thing you need to be aware of &#8211; returns. Amazon\u2019s FBA returns policy could have a big impact on your bottom line. <strong><em>So, keep reading and we\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know about Amazon FBA returns.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>How do returns work on Amazon FBA?<\/h2>\n<p>In order to effectively handle Amazon FBA returns, you first need to understand the returns process itself and the rules that Amazon asks merchants to adhere to.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s take a look\u2026<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/amazon-fba-or-fbm\/\">Amazon FBA<\/a> involves Amazon handling all of your fulfilment and customer service on your behalf. <strong>It also involves them handling refunds and returns on your behalf.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is an important point, as it means that a great deal of control is out of your hands. Should a customer want to return an item to you that they purchased on Amazon, a great deal of the process will be managed by Amazon, <strong>not you<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>The Amazon FBA returns and refunds process<\/h3>\n<p>When a customer requests to return an item for a refund, Amazon will refer to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=15015721&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref=efph_home_cont_200379860\">customer returns policies<\/a> to determine whether or not the item is eligible for return.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Note &#8211; Amazon can be flexible in its interpretation of these rules. For example, if a customer requests a return outside of the standard returns window, Amazon will sometimes still accept the return.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Should Amazon accept that the customer is eligible to return their item, then they will generally offer the customer one of two options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Returnless refund.<\/li>\n<li>Standard return and refund.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each of these two options are explained in further detail below.<\/p>\n<h4>What is an Amazon returnless refund?<\/h4>\n<p>In certain cases, Amazon may decide that a return qualifies for a \u2018returnless refund\u2019. This simply means that the customer will be given a refund without having to return the item to Amazon.<\/p>\n<h4>Amazon\u2019s standard return and refund policy<\/h4>\n<p>Should Amazon decide that an item doesn\u2019t qualify for a returnless refund, then they will request that the customer return the item. The item will be sent to the nearest fulfilment centre.<\/p>\n<p>What happens next? We\u2019ll let Amazon explain in their own words:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA return is an item a customer sends back to the fulfilment centre. We evaluate the condition of each returned item. If we determine that the item is sellable, we return it to your inventory. If we determine that it is unsellable (defective or damaged, for example), we assess who caused the damage. Then we decide if you are eligible for a reimbursement\u201d.<\/p>\n<h4>Why would an item be classed as unsellable?<\/h4>\n<p>At this point, you\u2019re probably wondering how Amazon decides if an item is unsellable. After all, if they find that the item is unsellable because of something you\u2019ve done, you could find yourself out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>According to Amazon themselves, a returned item can be classed as unsellable because of the following reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is not in the same condition as previously listed.<\/li>\n<li>It is defective, damaged, opened, lacking required labelling, prohibited, or otherwise unsuitable.<\/li>\n<li>The item may pose a health or safety risk to Amazon staff, or to the next customer who buys it. These sorts of items can include personal care products, consumables, and products with expiration dates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Amazon FBA returns reimbursements<\/h2>\n<p>So, what happens once Amazon has received and assessed an item?<\/p>\n<p>If they find that an item has been properly returned and is in sellable condition, it will be added back into your inventory and your seller account will be charged for the full value of the refund.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are some situations in which you will not be held responsible for the refund, and may receive a reimbursement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The customer fails to return the item to Amazon.<\/li>\n<li>It is determined that the item was damaged whilst under Amazon\u2019s control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In both of those situations, you will not have to cover the cost of a refund. And, if the money for the refund has already been taken from your seller account, you will receive a reimbursement.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Note &#8211; Amazon\u2019s FBA returns policy states that Amazon is not responsible for reimbursing merchants if the product has been damaged by the customer. In this instance, you\u2019ll simply have to \u2018eat\u2019 the cost of the item and accept that it\u2019s not sellable. <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tip &#8211; if Amazon decides that a returned item is not in a sellable condition, it\u2019s possible to create a \u2018removal order\u2019, where you can have the item returned to you, so you can inspect it yourself.<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Amazon FBA return fees<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to being familiar with the ins and outs of Amazon\u2019s returns process (and the scenarios in which you\u2019ll bear responsibility for covering the cost of the refund), you will also want to be familiar with Amazon\u2019s gamut of FBA returns fees.<\/p>\n<p>There are three separate fees which you could potentially be hit with, when it comes to dealing with Amazon FBA returns.<\/p>\n<h3>Shipping fee<\/h3>\n<p>Whenever a customer returns an item to Amazon, it\u2019s you that has to foot the bill for the shipping fees.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you have particular items or ranges which have high return rates, consider factoring these additional fees into their initial price; otherwise, you may find you make a continual loss on frequently-returned items.<\/p>\n<h3>Returns processing fee<\/h3>\n<p>For items in certain categories, Amazon will also charge you a \u2018returns processing fee\u2019. In many instances, this returns processing fee will be the same as the initial FBA fulfilment fee for that product.<\/p>\n<p>Items from the following categories are typically subject to an FBA returns processing fee:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apparel such as clothing and related accessories.<\/li>\n<li>Watches<\/li>\n<li>Shoes, handbags and sunglasses.<\/li>\n<li>Jewellery.<\/li>\n<li>Luggage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Restocking fee<\/h3>\n<p>In certain instances where an item has been opened by the customer, Amazon may charge them a 20% restocking fee, which will then be credited to your seller account.<\/p>\n<p><em>However, <\/em>if you\u2019ve already received a reimbursement for the returned item, you won\u2019t usually receive a restocking fee credit.<\/p>\n<h2>How to stay on top of your Amazon FBA returns<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ll have seen so far, Amazon FBA returns can be complex, time-consuming and can tie up some of your money until they have been resolved.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s vital that you \u2018stay on top\u2019 of your Amazon FBA returns so that you don\u2019t end up either out of pocket or short on inventory.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some tips that\u2019ll help you keep your Amazon FBA returns in order:<\/p>\n<h3>Track the return<\/h3>\n<p>This is arguably the most important way of avoiding complications. When you receive a return notification email from Amazon, go to your seller account and enter the refund notification email into the \u2018Advanced\u2019 section of the \u2018Manage Orders\u2019 section.<\/p>\n<p>Using this functionality, you\u2019ll be able to keep tabs on the progress of returns and confirm once they have been received by Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Should Amazon find that the item is sellable, then they should add it back into your active inventory. To check that they have done this, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy the ASIN number of the returned item and go to Inventory &gt; Manage FBA Inventory in your seller account.<\/li>\n<li>Pop the ASIN number into the search bar. This should provide you with the status of the item and where it is in your inventory.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Confirm receipt of refund<\/h3>\n<p>It sometimes happens that customers claim not to have received a refund. This is not always for nefarious reasons &#8211; sometimes it\u2019s just difficult to spot a return in your online banking (or identify where a return has come from).<\/p>\n<p>Should this happen to you, then you should open a support ticket within your seller account. Amazon should then be able to confirm if a refund has been issued.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep an eye on your seller central account<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a particularly busy Amazon merchant account, with multiple transactions per day, then it can be easy to miss the return notification emails that Amazon sends out.<\/p>\n<p>Make a habit of logging into your Amazon seller account on a daily basis and checking the returns section.<\/p>\n<p>You can access the returns section of your Amazon seller account by following this path: Reports &gt; Fulfilment &gt; Customer Concessions &gt; FBA Returns.<\/p>\n<h2>Outsource your Amazon FBA fulfilment<\/h2>\n<p>We don\u2019t blame you if the Amazon FBA returns process sounds daunting.
