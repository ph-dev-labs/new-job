You can sell on Amazon, either through Amazon FBA (fulfilment by Amazon) or FBM (Fulfillment By Merchant). As an FBA seller, you ship your products to an Amazon fulfilment centre, where they basically take care of the rest. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/amazon-fba-preperation-fulfilment\/\" rel=\"\">As an FBM seller, you fulfil all the orders yourself,<\/a> leaving you responsible for more of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we are going to cover each one so you can find out which will work best for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Does FBM Work?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an FBM seller, more of the work is on you. However, this may be beneficial to your operation. FBM could be a great choice If you sell heavy products or have a warehouse handling shipping and taking care of customer service. If you sell only a few products or they\u2019re homemade then FBM could be the better option for you as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get started as an FBM seller, you must do a few things. You go and create an Amazon sellers account, enter all your business information and start listing your products. Under the sellers portal, you click \u201c<\/span><b><i>I\u2019m adding a product not sold on Amazon<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d. Then enter the details of your product.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the rest of the process is on you when it comes to shipping, returns, and customer service. This is one reason why most sellers use FBA. As an FBM seller, the fees are cheaper because of the added responsibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Does FBA Work?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FBA is the best option for most people and why the majority of sellers use FBA. As an FBA seller, you pay more Amazon fees, but you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/amazon-fba-preperation-fulfilment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t deal with shipping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, returns, or customer service. It\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s so appealing. Essentially, getting started as an FBA seller is the same process as becoming an FBM seller. The only real difference is that you ship your products to an Amazon fulfilment centre. Become an Amazon FBA seller and get started today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can source your products from local stores, online retail stores, and wholesale suppliers. You can also start a private label company, where a 3rd party company makes your brand\u2019s product with your own business logo.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth mentioning that as an FBA seller you have the chance for your products to be featured in the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBuy Box\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> section. The buy box is where 83% of all Amazon sales come from. To do this you must meet the eligibility requirements. Even if you are eligible, it does not mean your products will be featured in the buy box.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The FBM and FBA Comparison Breakdown<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>Cost Comparison<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional plan prices begin at <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29.4 a month, plus fees to get started. You can use the individual plan where you pay <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">73 per item sold. However, with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">28.68 plan, you can sell as many products as you like. It\u2019s also worth mentioning Amazon collects a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sell.amazon.com\/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_priov_n#referral-fees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referral fee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from each sale regardless of your plan. The fee charged depends on the category of the item you are selling. As mentioned before the FBM fees are cheaper than The FBA fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The following shows an example of Amazon FBA fees and their ranging prices:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, FBA fee prices start at <\/span><b>\u00a3<\/b><b>1.45 <\/b><b><i>per unit<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fulfilment. That price is for the smallest items with max dimensions of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16&#8243; x 9&#8243; x 4&#8243; and weighs 4oz or less. That meagre <\/span><b>\u00a3<\/b><b>1.45<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per item goes up to<\/span> <b>\u00a3<\/b><b>100.97 + <\/b><b>\u00a3<\/b><b>.67\/lb<\/b> <b><i>above the first 90 lbs per unit<\/i><\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for all special sizes. That is a considerable price range, so make sure you know everything about your products\u2019 dimensions and specifications.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an FBM seller, you still must pay those referral fees we spoke about earlier. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to worry about the ranging FBA fulfilment fees we just covered. You must know of the other expenses involved in running an FBM business before starting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost for inventory storage and fulfilment is on the FBM seller. It could be as cheap as using your garage or home office for storage and fulfilment. On the other hand, it could be expensive. It may consist of warehouse leases and a team to handle logistics and customer service issues. For these reasons, no two FBM sellers are the same when it comes to cost. It could be more profitable for an FBA seller to become an FBM seller and vice versa. All of this depends on the final numbers, plan, and costs associated with running each business type.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>FBA Fees<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referral- (Ranges from 6% for personal computers to over 20% for specific jewellery, fine art, and gift cards)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory Storage &amp; Fulfillment- (Ranges from <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,45 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">per unit to <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100.97 + <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.67\/lb <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">above the first 90 lbs per unit)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monthly Plan<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individual: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.73 per item sold plus fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29.40 all you can sell plus fees<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>FBM Fees<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referral- (Ranges from 6% for personal computers to over 20% for specific jewellery, fine art, and gift cards)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory Storage, Customer Service, Fulfilment &amp; Materials- Price is N\/A.

You do this by communicating with your supplier unless you handle your own production and inventory storage. Selling with FBM can have its benefits. You can customize each order by giving out special notes, along with adding extra items to any package. Doing this gives you the option to overdeliver for your customers and provide added value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FBM sellers can benefit here by adding their own marketing materials that they would not be able to do via FBA. This can be a huge win for FBM sellers who have a separate ecommerce website they sell from. By adding your ecommerce store\u2019s marketing materials you can try to redirect those customers to your website. Not all customers will convert to buying straight from your ecommerce store. Those customers that do convert will be more profitable because you are not paying Amazon\u2019s fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have control over the entire customer experience when customers buy straight from your website. You will have access to your customers\u2019 information which allows you to directly retarget these people with your own marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember as an FBM seller the shipping is on you. Meaning you will have to choose <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your preferred shipping method. You still have the option to utilize Amazon for shipping your products. To do so click Amazon\u2019s \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy Shipping<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d feature after an item is sold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using Amazon to ship your products, they will supply tracking numbers that Amazon generates for you automatically, and sends to the customer. You must manage delivery by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirming, packing, and shipping your products as quickly as possible. When you are using premium or prime shipping your shipment must arrive to the customer by a certain time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also have to create \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your own return policy\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because as an FBM seller the returns and customer service are your responsibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an FBA seller here are the costs associated with your inventory\u2019s storage.
