In fact, it never really goes away. It\u2019s a powerful memory for many of us &#8211; and in this lies a powerful lesson for brands. If you can create a memorable unboxing experience, you can build brand loyalty and lodge your brand in your customer\u2019s memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here\u2019s how to create the ultimate unboxing experience for your brand.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you\u2019ll be aware one of the most important touchpoints is when your customer receives their package.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, many brands don\u2019t treat this as a moment to be celebrated. Making this touchpoint memorable (in a good way) can yield multiple benefits for your brand from customer satisfaction and loyalty to word-of-mouth marketing and repeat purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before we elaborate further, let\u2019s define what an unboxing experience actually is.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an unboxing experience?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put simply, an unboxing experience is the act of opening a box or package. But like so many things that sound simple, there\u2019s a whole lot more to an unboxing experience than the \u2018opening\u2019 part.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Like what?\u2019 you might ask.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, for one, an unboxing experience differs from a regular delivery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a regular delivery a brand will simply send their product in basic packaging and\u2026 that\u2019s about it. Whereas, with an unboxing experience, a brand puts a great deal of thought, care and attention into making the opening and unpacking process a memorable and enjoyable one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unboxing experiences are performances that involve your customers. The unboxing experience is as much a part of the purchase as the product itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of all those videos you see on YouTube of people unboxing their latest purchases (and we\u2019re fairly confident you will have seen one of these videos &#8211; according to Google one in five consumers has watched an unboxing video).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With unboxing experiences defined, let\u2019s look at <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can create the ultimate unboxing experience for your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to create a memorable unboxing experience for your customers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a lot to think about when you\u2019re attempting to create a memorable unboxing experience for your customers, so we\u2019ll take you through each step below. Some of these may be suitable for your business, whilst others may not &#8211; but we want to make you aware of the \u2018best practice\u2019 unboxing tips so you can create a process that works for you and your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use branded packaging<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may seem like an obvious one, but there\u2019s nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of a customer quite like their package turning up in a tatty, plain, boring cardboard box or envelope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what sort of packaging you\u2019re using for your products, make sure your customer will recognise that it\u2019s from you as soon as they lay their eyes on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This\u2019ll mean making an investment, but it\u2019s one that will certainly pay off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking at branded packaging you should be as consistent as possible. Draw up some brand guidelines specifically for packaging &#8211; you want to ensure that the customer experiences your brand in the same way across all of your different touchpoints. Your website, packaging and other marketing materials should all feel like they\u2019re part of the same brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every step of a customer\u2019s purchase journey should tell your brand story.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use unique and interesting packing materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing peanuts and bubble wrap might be fun for kids to play with, but they don\u2019t exactly exude quality or brand alignment. Instead, give some thought to the alternative materials you could use &#8211; especially if you can link them in some way to your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also something else to consider when it comes to packing materials; sustainability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustainability has risen up the ladder of consumer concerns in recent years, so many people won\u2019t take too kindly to discovering that their product has been packed with plastics or other non-recyclable materials. Again, you need to think about using packing materials that align with your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing materials that you could consider include cork, jute, corrugated bubble wrap or even more exotic materials such as mycelium (mushroom) and seaweed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3160\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/julian-o-hayon-Bs-zngH79Ds-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Apple is perhaps the best known example of a brand that provides a memorable unboxing experience\" width=\"800\" height=\"546\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/julian-o-hayon-Bs-zngH79Ds-unsplash.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/julian-o-hayon-Bs-zngH79Ds-unsplash-300x205.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/julian-o-hayon-Bs-zngH79Ds-unsplash-768x524.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Present your product in an appealing way<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realise we\u2019re getting detailed here, but even the way your product is presented within the package can have an impact upon the unboxing experience. No one wants to feel like their purchase has just been chucked into a box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, think of the beautiful elegant way in which Apple products are presented within their packages; elaborate tabs unravel the device, lifting it gently from its sitting place. (There\u2019s a good reason Apple employs an entire team of designers just to focus on packaging &#8211; in fact, they also have a dedicated team who simply spend months opening boxes\u2026)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to create a sensory experience for your customer when they\u2019re unboxing their purchase. To do this, think carefully about the dimensions of your product and how they relate to, and interact with, the dimensions of your packaging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this may add some additional costs, it also adds additional excitement to the unboxing experience. Imagine the excitement building in your customer as they slowly unwrap layer after layer, revealing their purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include a free gift<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone loves a nice surprise. You can do that by including a free gift in your packaging. It doesn\u2019t have to be of enormous value &#8211; in fact, the more thoughtful you can make it, the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free gifts could include stickers, a free sample of a related product, a discount code for money off their next order, or even just a small bag of sweets. The type of free gift you choose to include will in many ways be determined by your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the branded packaging mentioned above, free gifts should \u2018fit\u2019 with your brand. For example, if you\u2019re a fitness brand, you obviously wouldn\u2019t want to include free sweets with your orders.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use personalisation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Including a personal touch can transform the way a customer views your brand. Sometimes brands can seem cold and impersonal &#8211; a situation which is particularly hard to overcome if your business is wholly online. But, including something like a hand written note in the box can help you build a personal connection with your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding a personal touch such as a note also demonstrates to your customers that you are willing to invest extra time to connect with them &#8211; they\u2019re not \u2018just another customer\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget the essentials!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although you\u2019re trying to make your unboxing experience memorable, you don\u2019t want to make it memorable in a bad way &#8211; by forgetting essential items such as packing slips, invoices and delivery notes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be easy to forget the essentials when you\u2019re focused on making the unboxing experience as good as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, just because the essentials are things like invoices doesn\u2019t mean they have to be boring! Have some fun with the design and layout of these documents, bring them in line with your brand and try out some playful conversational copy to add some fun and personality to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promote yourself<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you make the boxing experience enjoyable enough then your customer won\u2019t mind if you engage in some self promotion. In fact, if your customer has enjoyed the unboxing experience enough they\u2019ll be particularly receptive to reading your latest brochure or leaflet &#8211; so don\u2019t forget to include these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Put all of these things into practice and you\u2019ll create an unboxing experience that captures the imagination and enthusiasm of your customers, building their loyalty towards your brand and improving the likelihood of them making future purchases.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3161\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4464823.jpg\" alt=\"There are many things you can do to provide a memorable unboxing experience from packaging to personalisation\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4464823.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4464823-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4464823-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of creating a memorable unboxing experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve told you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to create a memorable unboxing experience for your customers, but we thought we\u2019d provide a little more detail on the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of doing so. After all, it seems like a lot of effort to go to &#8211; but trust us, as you\u2019re about to read, it\u2019s well worth creating a memorable unboxing experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It makes a brilliant first impression<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a saying that\u2019s become a bit of a cliche, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s true &#8211; <\/span><b>first impressions matter<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your customer receives their purchase in uninspired, boring packaging they\u2019re not going to get a great first impression of your brand. If you\u2019re an eCommerce business then you\u2019ll know that you have far fewer customer touchpoints than traditional high street retailers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only time your customers get to handle your products is (generally) when they first receive it through the post. Therefore, it\u2019s vital that that first interaction is a good one &#8211; with a beautiful, branded package.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You wouldn\u2019t display your products in a shop in plain boring packaging, so you shouldn\u2019t send out your products in boring packaging either.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It increases perceived value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perception is reality. If someone perceives your product as being quality and of high value, they\u2019ll value it as such.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses offer commoditised products (that is, their products are not hugely different from their competitors\u2019 products) so a memorable unboxing experience can not only help set you apart, but also potentially improve the price point at which you can sell your products.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It creates free marketing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned earlier, unboxing videos have definitely become a \u2018thing\u2019 on YouTube. In fact, there are entire channels completely dedicated to unboxing things. It\u2019s a trend which has grown remarkably in recent years as the chart below demonstrates:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3162\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Unboxing-Trend.png\" alt=\"Consumer interest in unboxing has grown considerably in recent years\" width=\"850\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Unboxing-Trend.png 850w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Unboxing-Trend-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Unboxing-Trend-768x190.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an unboxing experience which is impressive enough and you could find your product showcased to millions of people across the world on YouTube.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The free marketing potential is not confined solely to YouTube though.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memorable unboxing experiences are shareable. People like to talk about their latest purchases and if opening that purchase was a delight, they\u2019ll talk about that too. So, you can benefit from free word of mouth advertising.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s not all. In today\u2019s content hungry environment, consumers are eager for things to share on social media. Instagram is awash with people sharing posts of their latest purchases (along with the packaging it came in). Take advantage of this by creating a postable\/Insta worthy unboxing experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can improve customer retention<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Yotpo, 37% of customers say it takes at least five purchases before they consider themselves loyal to a brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By creating a memorable unboxing experience you can increase the likelihood of further purchases. Being able to post about the unboxing experience also gives customers that \u2018influencer experience\u2019, increasing their engagement with your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is it time for your brand to create memorable unboxing experiences for your customers?<\/b><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to find out more ways to gain a competitive advantage for your business? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/contact\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact 3PL today<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for some friendly advice and support.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Find more advice for your eCommerce business on the <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/\"><b>3PL blog<\/b><\/a><b>\u2026<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/how-important-are-eco-friendly-packaging-options-to-todays-businesses\/\"><b>How Important Are Eco Friendly Packaging Options to Today\u2019s Businesses?<\/b><\/a><b> | <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/how-to-improve-your-shipping-process-make-it-your-competitive-advantage\/\"><b>How to Improve Your Shipping Process &amp; Make It Your Competitive Advantage<\/b><\/a><b> | <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/5-ways-to-improve-your-order-fulfillment-process\/\"><b>5 Ways to Improve Your Order Fulfillment Process<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We can all remember the childhood delight of opening presents can\u2019t we?
