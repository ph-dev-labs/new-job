But, if you want to make the most of this important sales period, you need to make sure that your order fulfilment process is properly optimised. <strong><em>Keep on reading to find out how to optimise your order fulfilment process for Father\u2019s Day now\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why is order fulfilment important?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You market and sell fantastic products. Surely that\u2019s enough to keep your customers happy right?!<\/p>\n<p>Well, whilst that <em>is<\/em> an important part of providing customer satisfaction, these days order fulfilment is just as, if not more, important.<\/p>\n<p>Changing customer expectations mean that consumers expect their orders to arrive correctly, well packaged, and quickly &#8211; all factors which are determined by your fulfilment process.<\/p>\n<p>Get your fulfilment process wrong and you\u2019ll quickly find yourself losing customers to competitors who have aced their fulfilment.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you want to nail your fulfilment process ahead of this year\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, you\u2019re going to want to do the things we\u2019ve detailed below.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to optimise your order fulfilment process ahead of Father\u2019s Day<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Below, we\u2019ve set out five key actions which you can take to optimise and improve your order fulfilment process, so that your customers who order goods from you for Father\u2019s Day have the best possible experience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Optimise your inventory management<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019ve got a big sales event like Father\u2019s Day approaching, the last thing you want is to run out of stock.<\/p>\n<p>You want to make sure that you\u2019ve got plenty of inventory on hand in order to fulfil the expected demand.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re using an appropriate warehouse management system (WMS) that gives you complete visibility over your current inventory.<\/p>\n<p>A good quality WMS will also provide you with plenty of raw data, so that you can make informed decisions about what you need to order and when.<\/p>\n<p>It can also be helpful to use this software to set automatic reorder triggers, so that popular items of inventory are automatically reordered when they hit a certain level of stock.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Integrate your systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If the different parts of your order fulfilment process are not talking to each other, then you could quickly find yourself in trouble, with mistakes with orders and unhappy customers.<\/p>\n<p>To make sure that your order fulfilment process is as efficient as possible, you want to make sure that all of your systems are properly integrated. For example, you need your order processing system to be integrated with your warehouse management system, so that your warehouse team knows which items they should be picking and packing.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want systems like your financial management software to be integrated with your warehouse management software so that you know how much of your capital is tied up in current inventory etc.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, it\u2019s far easier to use software like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/fusion-platform\/\">3PL Fusion<\/a> which can help integrate your various systems and processes into a single, easy to use dashboard.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Perk up your packaging<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>How are you packaging your orders? If you\u2019re just throwing your goods into drab, basic packaging, you may find that your customers start to flock elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because, like every other part of the fulfilment process, customer expectations are changing.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas in the past customers may have been quite content to receive their products in basic packaging, today they expect to see their orders arrive in sustainable, environmentally-friendly, branded packaging.<\/p>\n<p>Particularly when a consumer is ordering something for an event like Father\u2019s Day, they\u2019ll expect to have the option to personalise their order, such as adding a customised note within the box.<\/p>\n<p>However, these innovations cannot come at the expense of packaging integrity. Consumers are still just concerned about receiving their orders in one piece as they ever have been\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Guide &#8211; if you really want to create an exciting \u2018unboxing experience\u2019 for your customers, <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/how-to-create-the-ultimate-unboxing-experience-for-your-brand\/\"><strong><em>read our guide on how to do so here<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Ensure your return policy is clear and easy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Whether eCommerce managers like it or not, returns are a fact of life.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2021, 54% of British shoppers said they regularly return the products they have bought online.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s important that before you reach Father\u2019s Day, your eCommerce store not only has a returns policy that is clear and easy to understand, but allows customers to make returns simply.<\/p>\n<p>Return policies are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/rethinking-returns-why-return-policies-are-vital-for-a-good-customer-experience\/\">vital for a good customer experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to optimise your returns process is to not treat it as an afterthought. You should integrate returns (or \u2018reverse logistics\u2019 as we call it in the industry) into your order fulfilment process by creating dedicated processes for your warehouse team to handle returns.<\/p>\n<p>You can take other actions, such as making sure you have a dedicated area within your warehouse to handle returns, quality checks, and processes for reintegrating returned orders back into your inventory.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Think about outsourcing your fulfilment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As your eCommerce business grows, it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll find it more and more challenging to handle your fulfilment operations.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s only to be expected.<\/p>\n<p>After all, you probably founded your eCommerce brand in order to market and sell your products. You didn\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019d have to become an expert in fulfilment logistics too.<\/p>\n<p>The learning curve of fulfilment and logistics can be steep. There\u2019s a whole host of things to learn, from proper inventory management to the proper ways to handle returns and much, much more.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, as your fulfilment scales, you can find more and more of your capital tied up in expensive investments such as warehousing space. That\u2019s capital that you could be using to grow your business further.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With all of that in mind, it can often make commercial and financial sense to outsource your fulfilment to a third-party provider like <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/\"><strong>3PL<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way; a third-party logistics provider is dedicated entirely to getting fulfilment right.<\/p>\n<p>From dedicated warehousing space, to experts in fulfilment processes and deals with the leading couriers and delivery companies, a third-party logistics provider will be able to handle your fulfilment in a way which you probably can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re serious about nailing your order fulfilment process in time for this Father\u2019s Day, think about talking to a third-party logistics provider like 3PL today.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/get-started\/\">Learn how outsourced fulfilment<\/a> could boost your business now<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For more fulfilment, logistics and eCommerce advice and information, read the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/\"><strong>3PL blog<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/when-to-make-the-switch-from-in-house-to-outsourced-fulfilment\/\"><strong>When to Make the Switch From In-House to Outsourced Fulfilment?<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/learn-how-switching-to-a-3pl-can-save-your-business-money\/\"><strong>Learn How Switching to a 3PL Can Save Your Business Money<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-is-an-order-fulfilment-strategy\/\"><strong>What Is an Order Fulfilment Strategy?<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overflow=&#8221;visible&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; column_position=&#8221;default&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3915,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"wds_primary_category":0},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3913"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3914,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3913\/revisions\/3914"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3915"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3913"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3913"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3913"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
