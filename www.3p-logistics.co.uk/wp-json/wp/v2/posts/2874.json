While it was named \u2018word of the year\u2019 by Collins Dictionary back in 2016, for many eCommerce businesses, it is still just as confusing as ever.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-54087703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research by the British Chambers of Commerce<\/a>, less than half of UK international traders have applied for the required EORI number, while only 39% have checked to see whether they need to complete customs declarations for their goods.<\/p>\n<p>In defence of eCommerce businesses, 2020 has been a far from usual year. The Covid-19 breakout has thrown many of the rulebooks out of the window. While Brexit was once the headline of every newspaper, it was put on the backburner as the world dealt with more pressing issues.<\/p>\n<p>But, the big day isn\u2019t going anywhere!<\/p>\n<p>All businesses &#8211; eCommerce and otherwise &#8211; need to prepare now for the changes Brexit will be bringing our way next year&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>When will the UK leave the EU Single Market?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>The key date for preparing your business for Brexit is 1st January 2021.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the day that the UK will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union. It marks the end of the \u2018transition period\u2019 and new trading rules will officially come into effect.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s important that businesses act well in advance to ensure they are prepared. Otherwise, it\u2019s highly likely you will experience lengthy delays and hold ups when transporting goods between the EU and the UK.<\/p>\n<h2>So, exactly what will be changing on 1 January 2021?<\/h2>\n<p>Before Brexit, our place within the EU Single Market and Customs Union meant that we could trade goods freely with fellow members. Once customs had been cleared in one country, goods could be moved to other EU countries without tariffs, quotas or taxes.<\/p>\n<p>This is the most significant change for eCommerce businesses.<\/p>\n<p>There is now additional documentation you will need to prepare when trading with EU countries.<\/p>\n<h3>Prepare for Customs Declarations<\/h3>\n<p>From 1 January 2021 you will need to make customs declarations when both exporting and importing goods to or from the EU.<\/p>\n<p>This can be a complicated process. If you do it yourself, you will need to have compatible software that allows you to submit your declarations through the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight.<\/p>\n<p>However, many businesses choose to hire a customs broker to arrange this for them. Secure your arrangements now so you are ready to swing into action come January.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Useful links:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/customs-declarations-for-goods-brought-into-the-eu?step-by-step-nav=1ddb4c89-1fe9-4ad0-b561-c1b0158e6bc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to make customs declarations yourself<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/appoint-someone-to-deal-with-customs-on-your-behalf?step-by-step-nav=1ddb4c89-1fe9-4ad0-b561-c1b0158e6bc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting someone to deal with customs for you<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Check if you need a license or certificate for your products<\/h3>\n<p>The rules around what products you can export and import between the EU and UK are also set to be affected.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to get a license, and might have to pay an inspection fee, to import and export certain goods. These include animals, plants, food and agricultural products, chemicals and waste, controlled goods and diamonds &#8211; so many areas of trade won\u2019t be affected.<\/p>\n<p>For excise goods such as alcohol and tobacco, importing to the UK and exporting to the EU will be treated the same as the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>You might also need to check the labelling on any food and drinks products you are importing or exporting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Useful links:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/import-licences-and-certificates-from-1-january-2021?step-by-step-nav=1ddb4c89-1fe9-4ad0-b561-c1b0158e6bc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check what <strong>import<\/strong> licenses you need<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-to-consider-when-importing-goods-to-the-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check what <strong>export<\/strong> licenses you need<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Get an EORI Number<\/h3>\n<p>As of 1 January 2021 every trader will need an EORI number to move goods between Great Britain and the EU.<\/p>\n<p>This number will be required in order for you to clear your customs declarations. If you don\u2019t have it, your goods will not be allowed through.<\/p>\n<p>If you already move goods between the UK and <strong>non-EU<\/strong> countries, you may already have an EORI. However, if it doesn\u2019t start with the letters \u2018GB\u2019, you will need to apply for a new one.<\/p>\n<p>It should be pretty straightforward to apply and you can do it online.
