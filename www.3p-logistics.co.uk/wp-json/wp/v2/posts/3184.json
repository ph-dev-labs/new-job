But as shoppers have moved online, their expectations have changed &#8211; particularly when it comes to delivery and fulfilment. If you have faults in your fulfilment process you could be losing significant sums of money. Read on to find out more about fulfilment failures and what you can do to fix them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The boom in eCommerce<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retailers who have been able to adapt to widespread lockdowns and high street closures have reaped the benefit. To give you an idea of how well these businesses have done during this period, nearly 7 in 10 businesses (69%) say their average online order value has increased since the outbreak of coronavirus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only are <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people shopping online, they\u2019re <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>But\u2026<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failed deliveries and other problems with fulfilment threaten to derail this online shopping boom.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much of a problem are faults in fulfilment?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big one. With retailers rushing to provide an eCommerce alternative throughout the pandemic, the issue of faulty fulfilment has been truly laid bare.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand how big of a problem faulty fulfilment is, consider a piece of research from global intelligence agency GBG. Their <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 Fixing Failed Deliveries <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report found that 24% of businesses saw more than one in ten orders fail to be delivered at the first attempt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">76% of consumers surveyed for this report said they had experienced at least one late delivery in the last year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It gets worse. According to the report, brands cannot pass the blame onto their fulfilment partner. In fact, 41% of customers place blame on the retailer if their order is late. So, selecting an unreliable fulfilment partner can have negative consequences for a retailer\u2019s brand and reputation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on a survey of more than 300 retail executives and 3,000 consumers, this report should come as a wake up call for eCommerce businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a wake up call that should be heeded sooner rather than later. Why? Because at the heart of this report sits a heart stopping finding &#8211; <\/span><b>faults in fulfilment are costing businesses \u00a368k per year.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3185\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-extremely-costly-for-eCommerce-businesses.jpg\" alt=\"Fulfilment failures are costing businesses as much as \u00a368k per year!\" width=\"900\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-extremely-costly-for-eCommerce-businesses.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-extremely-costly-for-eCommerce-businesses-300x207.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-extremely-costly-for-eCommerce-businesses-768x530.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the most common reasons for fulfilment failures?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having just read that eye-watering figure, you may be a lot more concerned about tackling fulfilment failures. And, we don\u2019t blame you. We\u2019ll outline some of the common reasons for fulfilment failure so that you can take steps to address them before they impact your bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the most common reasons for fulfilment failures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor quality address data<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>The problem<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many eCommerce businesses, poor data is the main reason for failed deliveries. Of this data, incorrect address data is what causes the most problems. According to the aforementioned GBG report, 71% of businesses agree that inaccurate delivery addresses are a primary cause of failed delivery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do failed deliveries impact the reputation of eCommerce businesses, but they can result in many other downsides including negative online reviews, cancelled orders, reimbursements and poor customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The solution<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle the problem of incorrect address information, you should aim to verify this data. At present, only 57% of businesses in the UK undertake any form of address verification.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Address verification techniques include; internal address verification systems using third party data (such as Royal Mail), third-party address verification software, and manual address checks following the placement of an order.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor user experience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>The problem<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does incorrect address information get inputted into an order in the first place?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The blame lies primarily with poor online user experience. The use of smartphones to place orders has increased more than any other device over the past year, but with the increased use of smartphones comes more user experience challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical problems that shoppers experience when placing an order via their smartphones include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty entering or finding their home address.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problems entering payment details.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problems entering their order accurately.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The checkout process takes too long.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The screen is too small to see what they\u2019re buying.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these things can not only lead to failures in fulfilment, but also to abandoned carts and lost sales. For example, 41% of consumers say they would abandon an order if they couldn\u2019t easily enter their address.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The solution<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence (and impact) of poor user experience suggests that eCommerce retailers should invest in better checkout technology. This includes tools such as address verification software, bank verification, email validation, and geolocation to streamline the customer journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eCommerce businesses should also consider investing in regular user experience and conversion rate optimisation testing, which will flag any potential problems early &#8211; allowing them to tackle issues that cause failed fulfilment before they become even more problematic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in an improved user experience can yield big benefits. 70% of consumers claim they\u2019d be more likely to shop online with retailers that have a clean, streamlined checkout process, while 42% of consumers say they have more trust in retailers who offer address autocomplete options over those that don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3186\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-caused-by-a-variety-of-issues.jpg\" alt=\"Incorrect address data is the leading cause of fulfilment failures\" width=\"900\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-caused-by-a-variety-of-issues.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-caused-by-a-variety-of-issues-300x197.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fulfilment-failures-can-be-caused-by-a-variety-of-issues-768x504.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor smartphone experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>The problem<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Related to the importance of user experience, is smartphone experience.
