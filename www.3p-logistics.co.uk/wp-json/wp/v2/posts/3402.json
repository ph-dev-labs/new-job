What exactly is inventory control (sometimes also referred to as inventory management)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the short answer &#8211; inventory control is an organised, systematic approach to sourcing, storing, tracking, shipping, valuing and reporting on your inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you\u2019ve probably already guessed from the tone of this article, inventory control is a massively important part of running a successful eCommerce business.

They\u2019ll typically have invested large sums of money in their inventory and as such need to ensure that it\u2019s accounted for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By implementing proper inventory valuation methods you\u2019ll be able to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and your overall profitability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, holding an accurate picture of your inventory value will help you decide if you need to apply for lines of credit or other types of funding should you require it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Guide &#8211; read our complete guide to inventory valuation methods <\/i><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/inventory-valuation-methods-your-ecommerce-store-needs-to-know\/\"><b><i>here<\/i><\/b><\/a><b><i>.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of inventory<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word inventory can cover a whole gamut of different products, raw materials, or components.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When creating your inventory management system it\u2019s important that you drill down into what types of inventory you have. In other words, your system shouldn\u2019t view inventory as a single monolithic block. Instead, you should be able to segment your inventory so that it\u2019s easier for you and your team to identify different parts of your inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you define your different types of inventory, here are some common examples of inventory types:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Raw materials\/components<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; if you manufacture your own goods or products, then you\u2019ll need to include the raw materials\/components needed to manufacture them within your inventory. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Finished goods<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; this is the most common form of inventory for many eCommerce stores. Finished goods are usually supplied via a third-party manufacturer and stored in an eCommerce store\u2019s warehouse before being sold and shipped to customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Anticipated\/smoothing inventory<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; this is forms of inventory stocked in case of a surge in demand. For example, you may be an outdoor equipment supplier that holds some smoothing inventory of budget tents ahead of the festival season.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other forms of inventory, but the ones listed above are the most common.

Fail to stock enough inventory and you run the risk of being unable to fulfill orders, stock too much inventory and you\u2019ll have your money tied up in unsold products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good system of inventory forecasting uses historical sales data and other macro-level trends to help you make an educated prediction as to how much inventory you will need over your next peak sales period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory forecasting can be done on a quarterly, bi-annual or yearly basis (or intermittently). The best inventory forecasting cycle for your particular eCommerce business will depend on the industry vertical and markets you operate in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b><i>Guide &#8211; you can find out more about inventory and demand forecasting <\/i><\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/demand-forecasting\/\"><b><i>here<\/i><\/b><\/a><b><i>.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auditing your inventory<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know what the state of your inventory is at any particular time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An inventory audit will help you to check that your stock levels are accurate and align your eCommerce website\u2019s stock levels with your actual inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, a thorough analytical audit of your inventory should be part of your inventory control system. Most importantly, including auditing within your inventory control will ensure that your financial records and actual count of goods in stock match &#8211; preventing you from making costly fiscal errors!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple different ways of conducting an inventory audit:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Spot checks <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; counting inventory in person at your warehouse to see if it matches what\u2019s written in your formal records. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Third-party audits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; you can employ a third-party consultant to carry out an inventory audit on your behalf, thus providing an independent assessment of your inventory position and the accuracy of your records. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cut-off analysis<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; this involves completely pausing your operations (i.e. not receiving or shipping inventory) whilst you carry out a physical count of your inventory. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Invoice matching<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; do your invoices issued to customers match the amount and value of inventory shipped from your warehouse?

This means you don\u2019t have your capital tied up in hundreds or thousands of items that\u2019ll be sat on a shelf for months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two main types of inventory storage control system:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perpetual inventory system.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Periodic inventory system.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perpetual inventory system<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a perpetual inventory system, your inventory records are updated every time pieces of inventory are received, shipped, moved from one location to another, or scrapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This form of inventory control provides you with as close to a \u2018real time\u2019 view of your inventory as is possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For eCommerce businesses that have fast-moving inventory, the perpetual inventory system is generally the preferred option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Periodic inventory system<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a periodic inventory system, your inventory records are only updated on a periodic basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, an organisation will set out defined periods of time (e.g. every quarter) where they will undertake a review of their inventory and update their inventory records. As you can imagine though, this form of inventory control doesn&#8217;t give you as much visibility on the state of your inventory at any one time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you receive, book-in, quality assess, and store your inventory?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your inventory management system should include detailed end-to-end processes on how you handle your inventory. From the moment you receive your inventory to the second it\u2019s handed over to your courier for delivery to a customer, you should have defined processes to ensure that your overall handling process is as efficient as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimise your handling with 3PL<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a warehouse and dealing with reception, quality assessment and storage of inventory is a big job.

Your inventory control system should include detailing reporting on key inventory data points, so you can continually make informed decisions on your inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various forms of inventory reporting that you may choose to use. Which one will work best for you very much depends on the type of inventory you hold and the markets\/industries you operate in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning inventory<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning inventory is the total value of your available inventory at the beginning of a defined accounting period. Beginning inventory will provide you with data that\u2019s useful for balance sheets, tax reports and (internal) accounting documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning inventory can be calculated using the following formula:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(COGS + Ending Inventory) &#8211; Purchases = Beginning Inventory<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending inventory<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending inventory is the inventory you have available for sale at the end of a defined accounting period. When you reach the end of this defined period, you simply take your beginning inventory (see above), add net purchases and subtract the cost of goods sold. This provides you with your ending inventory value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending inventory can be calculated using the following formula:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases &#8211; COGS = Ending Inventory<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finished goods inventory<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many goods do you have in your inventory that are ready to be purchased by customers? That\u2019s what finished goods inventory calculates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By counting the value of all of the finished goods in your inventory you can work out the total value of your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sellable <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bear in mind that the definition of finished goods is malleable. For example, if you run a t-shirt factory a completed t-shirt is counted as a finished product. However, if you then sell a box of these t-shirts to a printing company that creates t-shirts with designs on the front &#8211; then the t-shirts are their raw material.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory weighted average<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another very common form of inventory reporting. Inventory weighted average, as you\u2019ll probably guess from the name, uses a weighted average to create an average value for every saleable item in your inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory weighted average is calculated using the following formula:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost of goods available for sale \/ Total number of units in inventory<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give your inventory control a boost with 3PL<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope you\u2019ve found our guide to inventory control useful.
