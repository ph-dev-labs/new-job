There are now over 25,000 sellers generating over \u00a31 million in sales across Amazon\u2019s ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The majority of these sellers fulfil their products directly through Amazon using their Fulfilment by Amazon Method (FBA), but the recent coronavirus global pandemic and surge in demand for \u2018essential goods\u2019 like groceries, medical products and household goods caused Amazon to announce that it would no longer be accepting other items in its warehouses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This action immediately had a direct impact on millions of third-party sellers, who rely heavily on Amazon\u2019s warehouses and fulfilment solutions to get their products into the hands of the end-user.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many Amazon sellers have now quickly realised that they were a little too over-dependent on Amazon and have quickly realised that there is another way to continue to use Amazon\u2019s platform to sell products.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>You can fulfil your own products on Amazon\u2019s website by choosing Fulfilment by Merchant (FBM)<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This option allows you to manage all of the storage, shipping and customer experience in house or you can still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/how-do-i-choose-the-right-order-fulfilment-partner\/\">use a third-party fulfilment specialist to fulfil your orders<\/a> for you.<\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many sellers believe that by using Amazon own FBA solution it enhances your chances of winning the \u2018BUY BOX\u2019 and generating more sales, but this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u00a0<em>in fact\u2026<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> FBM Sellers can <em>earn more revenue<\/em><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> FBM Sellers enjoy <em>better profit margins<\/em><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The main downside is that sellers need to be a little more \u2018hands-on\u2019 with their business if they are shipping orders in-house, but with many choosing to use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/amazon-fba-preperation-fulfilment\/\">fulfilment partner that specialises in Amazon fulfilment<\/a> this means they can get that time back and still enjoy the perks of Amazon selling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Feeling ready to switch to Amazon FBM? Here are some of our top tips for getting started\u2026<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Always provide valid tracking information<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amazon customers depend on tracking numbers to find out where their orders are and when they can expect to receive them. Make sure you keep them happy and the positive reviews coming by offering the same level of service and information they expect from Amazon.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Manage your delivery time<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amazon provides an estimated delivery time to buyers on the offer and checkout pages, so customers know when to expect an item they have ordered from you. This level of transparency and real-time information sets Amazon apart. You can modify your own handling time and transit time by following the instructions in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sellercentral.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/help\/external\/G202167920?language=en_GB\"><strong>Manage your delivery time Help page.<\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Set your default return instructions<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A slick returns process is the key to keeping your customers happy and getting your products back on sale as quickly as possible. Update your Amazon selling account with valid return instructions for all MFN orders.

You will need to provide a valid return address (if you are using a third-party fulfilment partner then don\u2019t forget to use their address).
