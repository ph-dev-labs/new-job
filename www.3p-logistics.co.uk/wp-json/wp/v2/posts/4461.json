The future trail blazers are potentially within our ranks and our competency-based program is attuned to identify such talent early on in the assessment process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\">Our carefully designed development program is designed to take colleagues on a learning journey with 3PL and help them fulfil their true potential in progressing through the three stages of Rookie, Rising Star and Rockstar at each and every level in the business from entry-level staff <\/span><span class=\"s4\">through to Senior Management. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\">Rosie Currie, HR Manager at <\/span><span class=\"s4\">3PL <\/span><span class=\"s4\">added: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\">\u201c<\/span><span class=\"s4\">The truth about career progression is that there\u2019s a dying opportunity for emerging talent to demonstrate their potential with a growing number of employers seeking to recruit \u201coven ready\u201d talent directly into the business as opposed to &#8220;growing their own\u201d. At 3PL we seek to adopt a more blended mix of new recruits fused alongside progressive colleagues.<\/span><span class=\"s4\">\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s4\">\u201c<\/span><span class=\"s4\">With our unique <em>Rookie to Rockstar<\/em> competency program y<\/span><span class=\"s4\">ou get to fly your own plane, sail your own ship, walk your own walk<\/span><span class=\"s4\"> and we simply create the progression doors for our colleagues to walk through for those colleagues that have the vision to do so. At 3PL we carry a simple belief that the limiting factor is the <\/span><span class=\"s4\">mindset of the individual and never the employer and working hard to ensure progressive mindsets exist throughout our organisation.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"s5\">More learning <\/span><span class=\"s5\">\/ <\/span><span class=\"s5\">more pay <\/span><span class=\"s5\">\/ <\/span><span class=\"s5\">more prospects \u2013 what\u2019s not to like<\/span><span class=\"s5\">? <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/careers\/\">Come join<strong><span class=\"s5\">\u00a0our journey<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The secret is out and we can\u2019t wait to share the news Over at 3PL Towers, our creative Labs have been in overdrive of late in mapping out the future&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":4462,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"wds_primary_category":0},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4461"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4461"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4461\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4465,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4461\/revisions\/4465"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4462"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4461"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4461"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4461"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
