If you don\u2019t have an appropriate strategy in place you\u2019ll quickly find yourself struggling to satisfy customer demands, struggling to accurately replenish your inventory and more. Want to avoid those problems? <strong><em>Then keep reading and 3PL will tell you everything you need to know about order fulfilment strategies.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What is order fulfilment?<\/h2>\n<p>Order fulfilment refers to the process of receiving and processing goods for onward distribution to customers.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds straightforward right?!<\/p>\n<p>Well, unfortunately, due to today\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/ecommerce-trends-you-need-to-know-to-increase-sales-in-2022\/\">hyper-competitive eCommerce environment<\/a>, surging consumer expectations, supply chain issues post-COVID 19 and more, there are myriad complexities to be factored into order fulfilment considerations.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these external factors, internal factors can make your order fulfilment more challenging than you first think.<\/p>\n<p>Once you start scaling your business, fulfilling orders from your spare bedroom is no longer really appropriate. You\u2019ll need to think about warehousing, fulfilment teams and a whole load of other considerations.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you want to be able to manage both the internal and external factors that will affect your fulfilment, it\u2019s vital that you have a solid fulfilment strategy in place.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Guide &#8211; find out more about the exact details of order fulfilment in our <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-is-ecommerce-order-fulfilment-and-how-does-it-work\/\"><strong><em>guide here<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What fulfilment strategies are there?<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully we\u2019ve driven the point home that it\u2019s important to have a fulfilment strategy in place.<\/p>\n<p>But what are your options?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s basically boils down to two choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-house fulfilment with CRM technology.<\/li>\n<li>Outsourced fulfilment with a 3PL.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll tell you more about each option below.<\/p>\n<h3>In-house fulfilment with CRM technology<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re keen to keep a tight control over your inventory, order processing, fulfilment and shipping, then in-house fulfilment may be the right option for you.<\/p>\n<p>In-house fulfilment is often favoured by brands that produced low-volume, high-value products such as luxury watches, jewellery or even cars.<\/p>\n<p>But, to get in-house fulfilment right (particularly at scale), you absolutely require a CRM.<\/p>\n<h4>What is a CRM?<\/h4>\n<p>CRM refers to Customer Relationship Management software. CRM software is essentially a tracking system that allows you to keep tabs on customer orders as they progress through the fulfilment process.<\/p>\n<p>CRM systems will do a lot of \u2018leg work\u2019 on your behalf, automating many tasks you may have previously had to do manually.<\/p>\n<p>A good CRM system will be able to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process orders.<\/li>\n<li>Create and manage documents and invoices related to orders.<\/li>\n<li>Monitor your inventory and flag when replenishment is required.<\/li>\n<li>Store and print shipping information.<\/li>\n<li>Run reports.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>CRMs also generally allow operators to add notes to individual orders; so if you\u2019ve spoken to the customer on the phone, you can make notes etc.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst CRM software is great &#8211; and can radically improve your fulfilment process &#8211; it\u2019s not a panacea.<\/p>\n<h4>The pros and cons of carrying out fulfilment in-house<\/h4>\n<p>Even with a CRM in place, there are still many you\u2019ll have to do yourself. To give you an idea of what\u2019s involved with in-house fulfilment, we\u2019ve set out the pros and cons of it in the table below:<\/p>\n<table width=\"602\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"602\"><strong>The pros and cons of in-house fulfilment<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\"><strong>Pros<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"301\"><strong>Cons<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You maintain control of your inventory.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">It takes a huge investment of time and money.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You continue to deal with customers directly.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You have to invest in a fulfilment team, CRM, warehousing space and more.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You gain experience in fulfilment.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You have to learn a whole new industry.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\"><\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You won\u2019t benefit from economies of scale.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>As you can see, in-house fulfilment does involve a trade-off.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unwilling to trust an external company to take care of your order fulfilment on your behalf, then you\u2019ve got an enormous amount of work and investment ahead of you.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us to our second type of order fulfilment strategy\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Outsourced fulfilment with a 3PL<\/h3>\n<p>Imagine if someone could take care of your warehousing, packaging, order processing, customer services, and shipping for you.<\/p>\n<p>Well, you don\u2019t have to imagine\u2026<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-are-the-key-factors-to-a-successful-ecommerce-order-fulfilment-process\/\">exactly what 3PLs do<\/a>. Third-party logistics companies specialise in carrying out fulfilment on behalf of other companies.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many 3PL companies are highly-flexible, meaning that they can help you with a single part of your fulfilment process, or the entire thing from end-to-end.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds great right? It does! But, it\u2019s important that you select the correct 3PL for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the fulfilment process is a crucial part of customer satisfaction. If you choose the wrong 3PL and they aren\u2019t able to run your fulfilment properly, you can quickly end up with many unhappy customers.<\/p>\n<h4>How to choose the right 3PL for your business<\/h4>\n<p>When \u2018shopping around\u2019 for a 3PL there are number of key things you should be looking for\/asking them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s their experience with fulfilment? Do they possess direct experience of fulfilment in your particular industry?<\/li>\n<li>Do they have a solid CRM system? Is it a system which provides you with visibility of your inventory and the fulfilment process?<\/li>\n<li>Can they flex? Are they able to ramp up their capacity to handle peak sales periods?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s their warehousing space like? Will it work for your products?<\/li>\n<li>What are their arrangements with shipping providers? Can they obtain competitive shipping rates?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These questions are just a few that you should be asking of prospective 3PL companies that want your business.<\/p>\n<h4>The pros and cons of outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL<\/h4>\n<p>Like in-house fulfilment, outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL has a mix of pros and cons. Again, to help you make a truly-informed decision, we\u2019ve set these out in the table below:<\/p>\n<table width=\"602\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"602\"><strong>The pros and cons of outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\"><strong>Pros<\/strong><\/td>\n<td width=\"301\"><strong>Cons<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">Time-served experts are handling your fulfilment for you.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You do not have direct control over your fulfilment process.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You don\u2019t have to invest in expensive fulfilment infrastructure such as a CRM, warehousing, fulfilment teams etc.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You have to pay for your outsourced fulfilment services.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You can focus on your core competencies such as marketing and selling your products.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">You won\u2019t learn as much about fulfilment.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">It will be easy to scale your fulfilment during peak periods.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\">For many 3PL providers, you will need to receive a minimum number of orders each month.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You\u2019ll be able to access new markets and customers.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">Your fulfilment will be a great deal smoother, leading to happier customers!<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"301\">You\u2019ll benefit from economies of scale such as cheaper shipping rates.<\/td>\n<td width=\"301\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>As the table above illustrates, there are a wide-range of benefits associated with outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL (if you are willing to put up with the minimal downsides).<\/p>\n<p>So, with those two options laid out before you, which one is the correct option for your business?<\/p>\n<h2>Which fulfilment strategy is right for you?<\/h2>\n<p>In choosing a fulfilment strategy for your business, there are a number of personal and external factors that will influence your choice.<\/p>\n<p>These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want to maintain control over your fulfilment?<\/li>\n<li>Do you receive over a certain number of orders each month? (Depending on the 3PL, this can vary from 200 to 500 orders per month).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whilst there are other factors that will influence your decision to outsource your fulfilment or not, the two above are perhaps the biggest when it comes to making your choice.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you don\u2019t have to make a decision on your own. It can be easier to talk to a 3PL directly and benefit from their advice and experience.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/get-started\/\">Speak to 3PL<\/a> about outsourcing your fulfilment today<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For more fulfilment, logistics and shipping advice, read the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/\"><strong>3PL blog<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u2026<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-is-3pl-a-guide-to-what-third-party-logistics-companies-do\/\"><strong>What Is 3PL: A Guide to What Third Party Logistics Companies Do<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-is-ecommerce-order-fulfilment-and-how-does-it-work\/\"><strong>What Is eCommerce Order Fulfilment and How Does It Work?<\/strong><\/a><strong> | <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/a-guide-to-omnichannel-fulfilment\/\"><strong>A Guide to Omnichannel Fulfilment<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;no-extra-padding&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;none&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3728,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"content-type":"","inline_featured_image":false,"wds_primary_category":0},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3723"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3723"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3723\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3730,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3723\/revisions\/3730"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3728"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3723"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3723"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3723"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
