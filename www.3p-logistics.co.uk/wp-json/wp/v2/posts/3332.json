If you want to avoid last minute panics and put your business in a position to maximise your peak selling season, now\u2019s the time to start preparing. <\/span><b><i>Read on to find out everything you need to know to get your eCommerce store ready for the peak selling season.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How important is your peak selling season?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many eCommerce businesses, it\u2019s obvious that the peak selling season is important &#8211; but <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exactly how important is it?\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re trying to justify further investment or budget from your board of directors or funders to prepare for your peak selling season, it will strengthen your case if you have solid data to hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how important could the peak selling season be for your business? According to the National Retail Federation, small to medium sized retailers now take up to 40% of their annual sales in the final two months of the year. Yes, you read that right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, where are all of those peak season purchases made? The answer is increasingly \u2018online\u2019. 19% of retailers expect a staggering <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three quarters <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of all of their peak sales to come from eCommerce.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no other way of looking at it.

But, is it really as simple as that? Perhaps not.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on which retail vertical you operate in, the markets you sell to and the products you offer, your peak selling season may be very different from other eCommerce businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3335\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"What are the key sales dates for eCommerce stores? \" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-scaled.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/What-are-the-key-sales-dates-for-eCommerce-stores-min-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know your key sales dates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re gearing your eCommerce business up for your peak selling season, it helps to break down said season into a series of key dates. Like any large task, your preparations will be made easier by having a series of \u2018target\u2019 dates to work towards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the key dates on the UK retail calendar that may impact your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Friday<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is arguably now the biggest sales event here in the UK. Data intelligence company PCA Predict estimates that Black Friday alone is worth \u00a32.5 billion to retailers. This insight is backed up by retailers themselves, with 35% saying that Black Friday is now their busiest day of the entire year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyber Monday<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Black Friday gaining traction throughout the mid-2010s, online-only retailers were determined not to miss out and so \u2018Cyber Monday\u2019 was born. Cyber Monday typically takes place a few days after Black Friday (often coinciding with, or just after, pay day).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Collection Day<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As click and collect and next-day delivery have become increasingly important for consumers, \u2018Last Collection Day\u2019 has become a key date in the retail calendar. Traditionally taking place on the last few days before Christmas, Last Collection Day is, as the name suggests, the last day that shoppers can pick up their orders in-store or make a purchase online for next day delivery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christmas Day<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who said the shops were shut on Christmas Day? Whilst Boxing Day used to be the biggest day in the retail calendar, these days online retailers are starting their Boxing Day sales on Christmas Day. Thanks to this tactic, Christmas Day is now an important shopping day in its own right, with the Centre for Retail Research estimating that an enormous \u00a31 billion was spent on Christmas Day 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Prime Day<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sell your products through Amazon, then Amazon Prime Day needs to be one of the key dates on your calendar. The fact that it\u2019s called Amazon Prime Day is a misnomer though, as the event actually takes place across two days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the event is restricted to Amazon Prime customers, given that there are 200 million of them it\u2019s an event eCommerce retailers cannot afford to ignore.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key sales dates across the rest of the world<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just the UK that loves a bargain! If you\u2019re an eCommerce store that sells to international markets, then these are some of the other important sales dates you should be factoring into your preparations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click Frenzy<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click Frenzy is basically the Australian version of Cyber Monday. Typically held during a single day in mid to late November each year, Click Frenzy sees retailers across Australia advertising their best deals on clickfrenzy.com.au.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its launch in 2012, Click Frenzy has expanded to run Click Frenzy days throughout the year, particularly May.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you sell into the Australian market, think about how Click Frenzy could impact you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alibaba Singles\u2019 Day<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During mid-November each year, the people of China eagerly await Alibaba\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day. It always takes place on 11th November and celebrates single people in opposition to Valentine\u2019s Day. Predominantly an online sales event, Singles\u2019 Day is enormously popular, generating over $74 billion in sales in 2020.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get your eCommerce store ready for the peak selling season<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With those key dates noted, you should have a good idea as to when your peak selling season will take place. Great, but now what? The next step is to start planning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start planning early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve published this article in June! If you\u2019re an eCommerce business that experiences its peak selling season around Christmas, then you should start planning now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of online retailers begin their preparations at least 4-6 months in advance of their peak selling season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3336\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"How to use data to prepare your eCommerce store for the peak selling season\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-scaled.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Use-data-to-prepare-your-eCommerce-store-for-the-peak-selling-season-min-2048x1356.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilise data<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should begin your planning by analysing as much sales and marketing data as you can from the previous year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The types of data you should be reviewing includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data from across your sales channels such as your website, social media accounts etc. You\u2019ll also benefit from analysing this data on a more granular level, for example, looking at sales by region, by country and by customer type.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data from your marketing efforts. How did PPC, SEO, Paid Social activity impact the number of interactions, engagements and purchases?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your warehouse efficiency. How well was inventory handled? What was the average shipping speed? What was the percentage of returns against overall sales?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What were the most popular categories and products? Does your data show any emerging trends? How will you adjust your inventory to match these trends?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examine data around any specific promotions that you ran last year. What were the aims of these promotions? Did the promotions achieve their targeted objectives?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By thoroughly analysing your sales and marketing data you can better plan for this year\u2019s peak selling season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key things that your data analysis may have flagged is the performance of your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google and other major search engines are continually changing their algorithms and the way they assess eCommerce websites &#8211; so, it\u2019s vital that your website is performing well against the search engines\u2019 criteria for website performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Google is currently rolling out a major change called \u2018Page Experience\u2019, which will fundamentally change the way Google ranks eCommerce sites.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other considerations that you should also factor into your website preparation. For example, is your website robust enough to handle a huge spike in traffic? You don\u2019t want your website to \u2018fall over\u2019 and leave thousands of potential customers unable to make a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring your website is in good order will set you up for a great peak selling season.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouse operations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many eCommerce companies, the warehouse is the beating heart of their business. After all, if you can\u2019t effectively pick, quality assess, pack and ship orders, you won\u2019t be in business for long.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which makes it all the more important that your warehouse operations are as optimised as possible ahead of your peak selling season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below we\u2019ve set out some things you can do to optimise your warehouse operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouse automation<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could potentially automate your warehouse operations in several ways.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, you could consider strategies such as conveyor systems that\u2019ll drive each pick to the required area of the warehouse, therefore speeding up the delivery of required items to the relevant zones of your warehouse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, you could digitise the picking process so that you can implement mobile picking. Mobile picking enables your warehouse operators to scan and update products at the point of picking, providing you with real time inventory information and further improving productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Align promotions with warehouse operations<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you are likely to be running several marketing campaigns throughout your peak selling season, you should make sure these are aligned with your warehouse operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, ensure that products that are featured in promotions are close to your packing stations, so they can be quickly and easily processed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking intelligently about how promoted products are stored, picked and packed will boost the productivity of your warehouse when you need it most.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3337\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Are your warehouse and logistics operations ready for the peak selling season?\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-scaled.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Ensure-that-your-warehouse-and-logistics-opeations-are-ready-for-the-peak-season-min-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logistics and delivery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of your preparations for the peak selling season, you should ensure that your logistics and delivery systems are prepared for large spikes in demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For at least six to eight weeks, your warehouse and shipping team will be shipping much larger numbers of orders than they would be during the rest of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of your preparations, ask yourself (and your team) the following questions:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a shipping partner (or mix of partners) that can handle peak demand?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you require earlier or later collections and deliveries?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How have your carriers\/shipping partners performed to date?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the answers to those questions, you may need to reevaluate your shipping process in order to effectively meet the demands of the peak selling season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for a logistics and delivery partner that can go beyond a standard delivery service (for example, offering picking, packing, customer service, delivery notifications etc), then consider partnering with a 3PL.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan for returns<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, returns are a fact of life for eCommerce retailers &#8211; especially during or just after the peak selling season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start planning for returns now. Ask yourself &#8211; do you have the capacity to process inbound returns and get resalable items back into your inventory? Are you set up to send customer notifications so they can see the progress of their returns? At what point will you refund a customer (and how will this impact your overall financial position if you receive a large number of returns)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factor in these things and you\u2019ll have a much smoother peak season.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human resources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most eCommerce retailers accept that they will need to hire additional workers to meet demand during their peak selling period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, exactly how many additional heads will you require? Where in your business will you need them (e.g. warehouse, call centre)?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also think carefully about how you will onboard and train these additional people. Temporary staff will boost your capacity, but if they\u2019re not sure of your operations, procedures and processes then you could see productivity levels dip when you need them to be most effective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as additional staff, you may need to think about additional hours too.
