All of which may require you to use warehouses and fulfillment centres. But, what exactly are these things? And, what\u2019s the difference between them? <\/span><b><i>Keep reading to find out.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do I need a warehouse or fulfillment centre?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we take a look at fulfillment centres and warehouses and the differences between them, let\u2019s first understand why an eCommerce business would need to use them in the first place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouses and fulfillment centres act as the foundation of a supply network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At their most basic, they provide you with somewhere to store all of your products\/inventory. But, as we\u2019ll see later, depending on whether it\u2019s a distribution or fulfillment centre, there are a variety of other things they can do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a warehouse?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A warehouse is usually a large building that is designed to store inventory in bulk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look inside your typical warehouse and you will see forklifts, large industrial shelves piled high with goods and generally plenty of workers in high-viz jackets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many eCommerce retailers, it\u2019s more cost effective to lease warehouse space on a joint basis with other eCommerce companies &#8211; or to use a warehousing provider on their behalf.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a warehouse you get somewhere to store your stock &#8211; but that\u2019s about it. When you make a sale to a consumer or another business, it\u2019s up to you to pick, pack and ship your orders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll have to either do this from the warehouse directly, or you\u2019ll need to regularly collect inventory from your warehouse and then fulfill the orders from your home or office.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can imagine, this isn\u2019t exactly efficient, which is what led to the development of fulfillment centres\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a fulfillment centre?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fulfillment centre is essentially a warehouse, but with a whole range of fulfillment services tagged on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulfillment centres are generally run by a third-party logistics provider (also known as a 3PL).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fulfillment centre run by a 3PL not only stores an eCommerce retailer\u2019s stock, but also fulfills orders on their behalf. Fulfillment centres have grown in popularity in recent years as they provide a complete end-to-end solution for eCommerce retailers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulfillment centres remove the burden of having to receive, store, pick, pack and fulfill products. By allowing logistics professionals to take care of these things via a fulfillment centre, eCommerce businesses can focus more on their core objective &#8211; marketing and selling their products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the difference between a warehouse and a fulfillment centre?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the face of it, warehouses and fulfillment centres are both large buildings in which inventory is stored, but as you\u2019ve probably already picked up, there are several important differences between the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3421\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-fulfillment-centre.jpg\" alt=\"What is a fulfillment centre? \" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-fulfillment-centre.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-fulfillment-centre-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-fulfillment-centre-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main differences are outlined below:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, both warehouses and fulfillment centres store inventory &#8211; but there\u2019s a key difference in the way that they store it &#8211; duration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouses are typically used for long-term storage. For example, if a garden furniture retailer chooses to buy stock on a yearly basis, they will use a warehouse to store the stock until it is ready to be sold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulfillment centres on the other hand turnover inventory quickly. Inventory does not normally sit in a fulfillment centre for longer than a month (and is usually there for much less time).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some larger eCommerce retailers will use both a warehouse and a fulfillment centre within their supply chains. The majority of their inventory will be stored in a warehouse, before being sent to a fulfillment centre as orders are received.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouses and fulfillment centres are operationally very different. Warehouses tend to be slower moving environments in which inventory is received and shipped out in bulk, with few other services taking place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fulfillment centre is a much faster moving environment in which inventory is received, quality assessed, stored (for a brief period of time), picked, packed and shipped out to customers. As you can imagine all of these services involve more staff and a much higher throughput of inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve already alluded to this point, but there is a significant difference in the frequency and volume of shipping that takes place between a warehouse and a fulfillment centre.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A warehouse may receive large bulk orders via road transport or rail on a monthly basis. This bulk inventory may then sit in the warehouse for months at a time before being sent to a brick and mortar store, or sent in smaller batches to fulfillment centres.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fulfillment centre meanwhile will usually receive inventory on a weekly, if not daily, basis with couriers and other shipping firms turning up throughout the day to ship completed orders to customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do fulfillment centres work?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulfillment centres basically take care of everything from the point an order has been placed with an eCommerce retailer online, to the package arriving at the customer\u2019s doorstep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fulfillment process generally looks something like this:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goods are received into the fulfillment centre.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inventory is quality assessed and then stored.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orders are received via an eCommerce store.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The items for the order are picked and packed according to the eCommerce store\u2019s requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The order is then shipped from the fulfillment centre by a shipping company to the customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any returns are also processed by the fulfillment centre (with the items returned to inventory if suitable).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fulfillment centres also offer other value-added services such as customer service (e.g. running call centres on behalf of their eCommerce clients), delivery tracking and notification and subscription box fulfillment etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re running an eCommerce store it\u2019s clear that compared to a traditional warehouse, fulfillment centres offer a complete solution for your order fulfillment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the benefits of using a fulfillment centre?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you\u2019re not fully convinced that you should be using a fulfillment centre to fulfill the orders from your eCommerce store, here are a few more benefits of using fulfillment centres.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go global<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As anyone who has tried will tell you, fulfilling international orders can be a pain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, with more than 2 billion people now shopping online worldwide, it can pay to offer international shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing a fulfillment centre that has an international network and global shipping partners means you can suddenly sell your products to many more people, but with none of the hassle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good quality fulfillment centre will have plenty of experience in shipping goods globally and will have a solid understanding of the various tax and regulatory hoops you\u2019ll need to jump through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free up space<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many eCommerce businesses start in a garage, basement or bedroom. But, as the business grows, space can quickly become an issue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working with a fulfillment centre you can free up much needed space in your home or office.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, you can probably cut out dealing with your inventory altogether. Many fulfillment centres are happy to receive finished goods directly from manufacturers. So you can get your suppliers to send your products directly to your fulfillment centre which can then send them out to your customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expertise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s face it, you might be great at running an eCommerce store, but it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re a logistics expert too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using a fulfillment centre you benefit from potentially decades of logistics and transport expertise. In addition to having experienced staff, fulfillment centres have usually invested in specialist equipment, software and have developed relationships with shipping companies over many years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this means they can fulfill your products in a timely, efficient, cost-effective way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to fulfillment, leave it to the experts!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scale<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a team of dedicated experts handling your fulfillment, you\u2019ll also be in a better position to scale your eCommerce business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, in the world of eCommerce customers expect rapid fulfillment of their orders. If you\u2019re trying to scale your business and continue to handle all of the orders yourself, it\u2019s almost inevitable that something will go wrong at some point, disappointing customers and damaging your reputation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using a fulfillment centre you\u2019ll be in a much better position to handle larger volumes of orders or seasonal peaks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"What does a warehouse do?\" width=\"900\" height=\"601\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-warehouse.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-warehouse-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/What-is-a-warehouse-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Economies of scale<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to handle your own fulfillment then you\u2019ll need to invest in warehouse space, shipping partners, staffing, software and much more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, you can partner with a fulfillment centre and thereby benefit from economies of scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because fulfillment centres are often dealing with multiple eCommerce stores they can invest in large warehousing space, have great bulk deals with shipping partners and much more. In other words, they operate via economies of scale &#8211; which you will benefit from!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customised orders<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How have you been sending your products to customers so far? We\u2019re willing to bet it\u2019s mostly in generic packages; brown boxes, padded envelopes, that kind of thing\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, a good quality fulfillment centre will give you the option of sending your orders in custom packaging. They will take your inventory and pack it for you in custom packaging before it is shipped to the customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today\u2019s highly-competitive retail environment, seemingly small touches such as customised packaging can go a long way to building customer loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on what matters<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set up your eCommerce store it\u2019s unlikely that one of your passions was supply chains and logistics. But, as your store grows, you\u2019ll find that more and more of your time is taken up with it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of focusing on your next big product launch or tinkering with ways to improve your conversion rate on your website, you\u2019ll end up taking calls from disgruntled customers because their order hasn\u2019t turned up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a fulfillment centre takes the headaches of supply chain and logistics away from you &#8211; so you can focus on what matters &#8211; growing your eCommerce business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve your customer service<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you able to answer the phone to customers at any time of day? Do you have the tech to provide real-time delivery tracking notifications? If not, then you\u2019ll probably benefit from partnering with a fulfillment centre.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the old saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s easier to keep an existing customer than gain a new one\u201d. By using a fulfillment centre that\u2019s able to provide customer services such as telephone support and delivery tracking, you\u2019ll be improving the odds of retaining customers and building a loyal customer base.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsource your fulfillment today<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still doing your own fulfillment, it\u2019s probably time to start thinking about outsourcing it to a dedicated fulfillment partner like 3PL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have years of (award winning!) experience providing multi channel eCommerce fulfillment to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/case-studies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leading brands<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
