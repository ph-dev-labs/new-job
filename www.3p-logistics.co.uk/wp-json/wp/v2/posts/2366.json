We take great pride in embracing key worker status. Our business and its people have proved resilient in the past and will do so again this time around.&#8221; Ian Walker, Managing Director at 3PL, explained<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have big warehouses and against a backdrop of a significantly reduced workforce, our employees can work safely and in line with Government guidelines. In doing so we continue to provide continuity of service at a time when our customers need us the most. Unlike Amazon UK we haven\u2019t applied a selective approach to who we service during this time as loyalty is a core value and our extended commitments will be remembered long after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/covid19-community-update\/\">COVID-19<\/a> has passed. With a further extension to lockdown announced recently, we will again reassess the impact and adapt accordingly to ensure we continue to provide the high level of service our customers have come to expect from 3PL.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About 3PL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based in Wigan, 3PL offers multichannel ecommerce fulfilment and logistics for growing brands.
