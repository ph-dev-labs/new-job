Do you want to avoid the hassle of haggling with retailers and marketplaces? Then you could benefit from adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment strategy. Want to know more about this emergent fulfilment model? <strong><em>Then keep reading and 3PL will tell you everything you need to know about D2C eCommerce fulfilment\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>What is D2C eCommerce fulfilment?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics. What exactly is D2C eCommerce fulfilment?<\/p>\n<p>Well, as the name suggests, direct to consumer (D2C) fulfilment involves a manufacturer of a product marketing and selling their products directly to a consumer, leaving out the usual intermediaries such as retailers and marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>Direct to consumer brands are able to design and manufacture their own products, conduct their own marketing (with the vast majority of this marketing taking place on social media platforms), and fulfil the products themselves, creating a direct relationship with their customer base.<\/p>\n<p>You may not realise it, but you\u2019ve probably purchased products from D2C brands yourself. Some of the biggest and most well-known D2C brands include Dollar Shave Club, Casper, Warby Parker, Gymshark, Gousto, Glossier, and many others.<\/p>\n<h2>The rise and rise of D2C eCommerce fulfilment<\/h2>\n<p>As those brand names indicate, the D2C business model has become big business in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Here in the UK, direct to consumer brands generated an enormous \u00a396 billion in sales in 2020. And, that number is only set to grow.<\/p>\n<p>According to market research firm Statista, the direct to consumer market in the UK is set to be worth \u00a3120 billion by 2023.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a similar story in other countries, with the D2C market expected to be worth $175 billion in the US by 2023.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s big business. So much so, that big businesses are now getting in on the D2C act themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the initial D2C brands to make it big were digitally-native startups, an increasing number of very large established brands are now adopting the direct to consumer fulfilment model. Think Apple, GAP and other established businesses that have moved more to a direct to consumer model rather than selling through intermediaries.<\/p>\n<p>Other major established businesses have gone one further and simply acquired popular direct to consumer brands outright. Perhaps the best example of this is Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by the multinational Unilever for $1 billion in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re thinking about adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model for your eCommerce brand, you\u2019ll be in very good company.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of direct to consumer fulfilment?<\/h2>\n<p>There must be some good reasons as to why so many brands &#8211; new and old alike &#8211; are adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve touched on some of these reasons above, but to really drive the point home, we\u2019ve set out the key benefits of D2C fulfilment in more detail below.<\/p>\n<h3>Control<\/h3>\n<p>With direct to consumer fulfilment, the destiny of your brand is completely in your hands.<\/p>\n<p>You have complete control over every part of your brand and its products. From the design and manufacture of your products to the way in which they are marketed, to the way in which your products reach your customers, you are in control.<\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t be beholden to the whims of retailers and marketplaces, who will often want a say in pricing, marketing and other important factors.<\/p>\n<h3>Brand messaging<\/h3>\n<p>Related to the point above about control, by adopting a direct to consumer fulfilment model, you\u2019ll be able to determine your brand messaging with no outside interference.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you sell household consumables then you\u2019ll be able to set a price point that reflects your brand. So, if you want your brand to be perceived as an aspirational and high end one, then you can set your prices slightly higher than equivalent competitors.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not always possible when you\u2019re selling through intermediaries such as supermarkets. In many cases, supermarkets will want you to commit to periodic discounting, bulk buy deals and other similar pricing tactics.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re keen to maintain the integrity of your brand, then avoiding these sorts of tactics is a must, and is something that the D2C fulfilment model allows you to do.<\/p>\n<h3>Margins<\/h3>\n<p>Talking of pricing, we come to another major benefit of the direct to consumer fulfilment model &#8211; margins.<\/p>\n<p>Because there are no middlemen involved, you can choose to either sell your products at a lower price point, beating your competitors and grabbing a larger share of the market, or you can sell your products and simply enjoy a higher profit margin.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, the direct to consumer fulfilment model allows you to generate more revenue and\/or profits.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct access to your customers<\/h3>\n<p>By selling directly you will have the opportunity to build strong relationships with your customers.<\/p>\n<p>As you will be in contact with your customers through each stage of the sales process, from the initial marketing activity through to post-sales customer service, you\u2019ll be able to form a much stronger bond with your customers than if you were to sell through intermediaries.<\/p>\n<p>This essentially allows you to build up a base of customers that you \u2018own\u2019. You\u2019ll be able to gather important data such as email addresses, location, purchasing preferences and more. All of which will help you to retain customers over the longer term.<\/p>\n<h3>Brand loyalty<\/h3>\n<p>The direct to consumer fulfilment model comes with another significant benefit &#8211; brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>As you are able to maintain direct communications with your customers throughout the entire buying journey, you are able to make sure they have a great experience. This helps to establish strong brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way, if you\u2019re selling your products through an intermediary such as a brick and mortar store, there\u2019s nothing stopping a stroppy sales assistant from completely spoiling the buying experience.<\/p>\n<p>That kind of thing can rub off negatively on your brand\u2026 Selling directly to consumers eliminates the possibility of that kind of thing from happening.<\/p>\n<h2>Why you should outsource your D2C fulfilment<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ve seen so far, direct to consumer fulfilment has many benefits. But, it\u2019s not without its challenges, particularly when it comes to the fulfilment-specific elements.<\/p>\n<p>As your brand grows and the volume of your sales increases, you\u2019ll typically experience the following fulfilment-related challenges:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Difficulties scaling<\/strong> &#8211; at small volumes, fulfilment can be handled in-house with relative ease. You can pick, pack and fulfil orders with a small team. But, what happens when your business starts to scale? Trying to run a warehouse, arrange picking and packing, finding couriers etc, will be far more of a challenge. Outsourcing your fulfilment to a third-party provider can solve this.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time<\/strong> &#8211; you can quickly find that more and more of your time is spent dealing with fulfilment-related issues. Whether it&#8217;s arranging for more warehousing space, or trying to negotiate deals with couriers, fulfilment can be a time sink. Outsourcing your fulfilment allows you to spend your time on other business-critical tasks such as product development, marketing and sales.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Shipping costs<\/strong> &#8211; if you\u2019re attempting to negotiate courier and shipping deals on your own, then you\u2019re not going to be getting the best prices. That\u2019s a fact. When you outsource your fulfilment to a third party, they are able to negotiate much more competitive prices, simply because they benefit from economies of scale and industry expertise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those are just a few of the reasons why you should consider outsourcing your fulfilment to a 3PL if you\u2019re thinking of adopting a direct to consumer business model.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the benefits of outsourcing fulfilment for your direct to consumer brand, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/get-started\/\">speak to the 3PL team today<\/a>.
