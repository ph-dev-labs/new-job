Overnight, the digital world became more important than ever before and for all retail-centric brands ecommerce suddenly became their \u2018everything\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Brands that were already seeing success online, had to adapt quickly and find better ways to build an audience and increase conversations without being seen as \u2018tone deaf\u2019 to the global situation. Established bricks and mortar retail brands that had been slow to embrace digital, had to pivot quickly or risk going out of business.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Three months ago, the world was a very different place.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/internetretailing.net\/industry\/industry\/uk-ecommerce-sales-continue-to-rise-growing-168-in-may--but-fraud-grows-too-21526\">Ecommerce transactions grew in the UK by 168% in May<\/a> compared to the same period last year. The sharp increase in online sales also saw the demand for ecommerce order fulfilment increase. At 3PL, we saw demand for our order fulfilment solutions increase by 248% compared to the same period last year.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What caused the surge in interest in outsourced order fulfilment? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There were two main reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brand in sectors that saw huge demand like healthcare, wellbeing and essential goods needed to find a better way of coping with the increased demand and had no experience of coping in-house with fulfilling orders in such large volumes. They needed to find a partner that had experience and expertise in handling large volumes.<\/li>\n<li>Some retail sectors were hit hard. Luxury and clothing were hit the hardest, with more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/mar\/26\/next-stops-online-shopping-amid-uk-coronavirus-restrictions\">\u00a311.1 billion set to be wiped off fashion sales in 2020.<\/a> Businesses were looking at where they could make the biggest savings and ease some of the pressure they were experiencing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>The Pandemic Isn\u2019t Over<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although governments are encouraging businesses to operate as normal and retailers are opening their shutters again, there is every chance that as winter as approaches, we could get a dreaded second wave. Until there is a vaccine, COVD-19 isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.<\/p>\n<p>Should a second wave happen then governments have warned they won\u2019t hesitate in reintroducing lockdown measures.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What This Means for Your Business &amp; What You Can Do About It<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Time is already running out if you want to de-risk your order fulfilment strategy, you should already be considering how you would cope if a second wave arrives.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Double Down on Digital<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>If you haven\u2019t been shifting your focus to online already, then now is the time to put your time and energy into improving every part of your online experience.
