During this time, I specialised in the industrial sector, making the transition to 3PL much smoother. At 3PL my role as Business Development Manager has me focusing primarily on bringing new business onboard. As part of this, ensuring a quality introduction for new companies, working closely with our customer service team to ensure the needs of the customer are prioritised and working with those customers to enhance the growth of their businesses and elevate them to the next level.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to get into your current job role? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JT:<\/strong> I love to meet and speak to people but also love the idea of a complex sell. It became apparent that the complexity of third-party logistics was a real interest. Working with businesses to provide solutions that will realise their growth potential is a real buzz for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to join 3PL?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JT:<\/strong> 3PL is a driven, professional business with a homely\/community feel.

Its flexibility has seen the solutions we provide mould into different guises which work to suit the solution that the customer requires. To stand still in this industry renders your relevance mute. Technology has played a huge part in this transformation. Technological advances have made the possibilities almost endless and timescales reduce out of recognition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s a fun fact about you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JT:<\/strong> During my early 20\u2019s I spent 7 months in Australia playing cricket.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s been your personal career highlight working at 3PL?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JT: <\/strong>Meeting the team.
