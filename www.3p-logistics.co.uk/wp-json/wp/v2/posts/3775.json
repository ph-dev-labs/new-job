Then keep reading and 3PL will tell you the seven strategies you can use to supercharge the growth of your eCommerce business this year.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1 &#8211; Undertake a persona exercise<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Who do you sell to? How old are they? Where do they live? What are their goals and ambitions?<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you really want to scale your eCommerce business, it\u2019s absolutely essential that you nail down your target audience. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For that reason, you should undertake what\u2019s known as a \u2018persona exercise\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>This involves creating a series of personas who represent your audience and customers.<\/p>\n<p>To create these personas you\u2019ll want to look at both quantitative and qualitative information. For example, check the demographics section of your Google Analytics account. This\u2019ll tell you the breakdown of your website visitors by age and gender.<\/p>\n<p>This provides you with an excellent initial insight into your audience.<\/p>\n<p>But, if you can, you should take things further.<\/p>\n<p>Consider sending an email to previous customers asking them to take a survey. Ask your social media followers questions. Ask for key information when completing transactions with customers.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you do, try to glean useful information from your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll be able to analyse your data and identify common trends e.g. the majority of your customers fall within a certain age range, more customers are one gender than the other etc.<\/p>\n<p>Use these common trends to create your target personas.<\/p>\n<p>You can then use these personas every time you\u2019re creating a new marketing campaign, or developing a new product.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be surprised at how much more effective your efforts are once you\u2019ve truly nailed down who your target customers are\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2 &#8211; Optimise your website<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Is your website working as hard as it could be?<\/p>\n<p>After all, you don\u2019t want to spend time and money driving people to your website, only for them to find it difficult to use and leave without purchasing anything.<\/p>\n<p>It can pay to invest in user experience (also known as \u2018UX\u2019). But, don\u2019t just take our word for it.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study by Forrester Research, implementing UX-friendly design on an eCommerce website can lift sales by up to 400%.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly, 400%!!!<\/p>\n<p>UX is an in-depth discipline, and it\u2019s certainly worth speaking to a specialist agency or professional if you really want to invest in it, but for starters, here are a few basic ways you can improve the UX on your website:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use white space to highlight critical parts of your site (e.g. product images). The use of padding and margins can increase user attention by as much as 20%.<\/li>\n<li>Improve your page speed. The quicker your site loads, the less likely visitors are to exit your site.<\/li>\n<li>Use appealing calls to action. Highlight the benefits of your products and how they will make the reader\u2019s life better!<\/li>\n<li>Use original images. According to a study by MGA Advertising, 67% of consumers consider high-quality images to be an important factor in their decision to purchase.<\/li>\n<li>Segment important information using bullet points. Consumers want to be able to find and read information about a product quickly. Bullet points help them to do that!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>3 &#8211; Create social media campaigns<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>More and more people live on social media.<\/p>\n<p>From your persona exercise you should have a good idea as to where your target customers hang out online.<\/p>\n<p>With that information, you should create carefully targeted and curated social media campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, social media campaigns are no longer simply about developing brand awareness. Platforms such as Instagram can now be used to proactively generate sales, with ever-more eCommerce features being added.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important not to neglect an older form of digital marketing &#8211; email campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst social media campaigns are incredibly effective, you should never forget that you\u2019re using someone else\u2019s platform. You are subject to their ever changing terms and conditions.<\/p>\n<p>With an email database on the other hand, you have ownership over the data and the way it is used.<\/p>\n<p>So, be sure to include a pop-up on your website encouraging people to sign up to your email newsletter. The best way to encourage sign ups is to offer a discount code on a customer\u2019s next purchase.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4 &#8211; Work with influencers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Depending on your brand and the products that you sell, you may want to consider working with influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Influencers provide you with an opportunity to tap into a ready made (usually large) audience of people who will be receptive to your brand. Plus, being associated with the right influencer can confer increased legitimacy on your brand.<\/p>\n<p>An influencer\u2019s \u2018seal of approval\u2019 can mean millions of pounds in revenue for some brands.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, for an influencer campaign to work, you need to work with the right type of influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Based on your persona exercise, you should have a clear idea as to what type of influencers will resonate most strongly with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of actually setting up an influencer campaign, there are dedicated agencies that can do this for you.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is possible to run an influencer campaign yourself. Many influencers will be able to provide you with a rate card, which sets out how much they charge per post etc.<\/p>\n<p>Some influencers will work on a gifting basis e.g. they will promote your brand in exchange for some of your products. Other influencers will expect a fee in addition to some of your products. Still others will expect a fee, some of your products and a commission for every sale made via their posts.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5 &#8211; Boost your customer service<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s an old adage but customer service really can make or break a brand.<\/p>\n<p>And, it\u2019s an adage which is more relevant than ever. The internet makes it incredibly easy for consumers to switch to an alternative brand &#8211; so, you really need to make every effort you can to provide outstanding customer service.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re undoubtedly already providing customer service, even if it\u2019s just via an email or telephone helpline.<\/p>\n<p>But, have you considered how you could make your customer service even better?<\/p>\n<p>Consider asking customers for their feedback. You can include a survey in your order confirmation emails. Add a feedback box on your website. Send follow up emails post-purchase.<\/p>\n<p>From there you\u2019ll be able to glean some (hopefully) useful insights that will help you improve your customer service.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6 &#8211; Offer international shipping<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you want to boost your eCommerce website\u2019s revenue in 2022, there\u2019s one particular thing that really can supercharge your growth &#8211; international shipping.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way; if you\u2019re only offering domestic shipping, then you\u2019ll be limiting yourself to a single market.<\/p>\n<p>By offering international shipping you\u2019ll literally be opening up your business to millions more potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst international shipping may seem daunting -you\u2019ll often have to navigate all sorts of duties, taxes, and shipping requirements &#8211; it needn\u2019t be.<\/p>\n<p>To make international shipping headache free, we\u2019d recommend outsourcing your shipping to a third-party logistics provider, such as ourselves here at 3PL.<\/p>\n<p>An outsourced fulfilment and shipping provider will be able to take care of all of the intricacies and details of international shipping, leaving you free to concentrate on your core business.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, third-party logistics providers often operate at scale on behalf of multiple companies, meaning they are able to negotiate the kinds of shipping rates you can only dream of!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7 &#8211; Outsource your omnichannel eCommerce order fulfilment<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The single most effective way of turbocharging your revenue growth is to outsource your omnichannel eCommerce order fulfilment.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling your products through multiple different sales channels (and who isn\u2019t these days!?), then you\u2019ll know that keeping an eye on your orders and fulfilment via all of these different channels can be pretty time consuming and complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing your omnichannel fulfilment to a third-party provider eliminates all of these complications and headaches.<\/p>\n<p>How?
