However, one metric that is often overlooked but holds significant importance is the average order value (AOV). In this guide, we will explain what AOV is, how to calculate it, and how to increase it to maximise your ecommerce revenue.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding Average Order Value (AOV) and Why It Matters<\/h2>\n<p>AOV is the average amount of money a customer spends on your website per order. AOV is an essential metric for ecommerce businesses because it directly impacts the bottom line. By increasing the AOV, you can generate more revenue without necessarily increasing the number of orders or traffic to your website. This means you can maximize your revenue without incurring additional marketing or acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Calculate Your Store&#8217;s AOV<\/h2>\n<p>To calculate your store&#8217;s AOV, you need to divide the total revenue generated by the number of orders. You can find this information in your ecommerce platform&#8217;s analytics or by exporting a sales report. For example, if your store generated \u00a320,000 in revenue from 200 orders, your AOV would be \u00a3100. It&#8217;s important to calculate your AOV regularly and track changes over time. This will help you identify trends and adjust your strategies accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>How AOV Impacts Business Decisions<\/h2>\n<p>Raising your average order value (AOV) offers more benefits than just boosting your revenue. It can also enhance the efficiency of your entire business.<\/p>\n<p>By gaining deeper insights into your customers and boosting your conversion rates, you can optimise your advertising budget and implement a more beneficial pricing strategy for both you and your clients. AOV serves as a critical indicator of overall business performance, and it can be a valuable tool to increase cash flow in other areas of the business, thereby boosting overall revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>Marketing Strategies<\/h3>\n<p>By knowing your AOV, you can determine how much you can afford to spend on customer acquisition. For example, if your AOV is \u00a3100, and you spend \u00a350 on advertising to acquire a customer, you will need to generate two orders to break even.<\/p>\n<h3>Inventory Management<\/h3>\n<p>AOV can also help you manage your inventory. By analysing which products are frequently purchased together, you can bundle them and increase AOV.<\/p>\n<h3>Pricing strategy<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to take your store&#8217;s AOV into account when making changes to your pricing strategy. If you see an increase in AOV and maintain or improve your return on investment (ROI) after adjusting your prices, then you&#8217;re on the right track. Although some brands are hesitant to raise prices out of fear that it will reduce conversion rates and turn off customers, the impact of price changes can vary depending on how your brand is perceived by consumers. Some brands are seen as luxury brands, while others are known for offering discounts. Finding the right balance can be challenging and may raise concerns about profit margins.<\/p>\n<h2>What Impacts Your Store&#8217;s AOV?<\/h2>\n<p>Several factors can impact your store&#8217;s AOV, including:<\/p>\n<h3>Product Selection<\/h3>\n<p>The selection of products you offer also impacts your AOV. If you only offer low-priced items, customers may not see the value in purchasing multiple products, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering higher-priced items or product bundles can encourage customers to spend more, resulting in a higher AOV. Additionally, offering a variety of products that appeal to different customer needs and preferences can increase the likelihood of customers purchasing more items.<\/p>\n<h3>Website Design<\/h3>\n<p>The design and layout of your website can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. A poorly designed website can be confusing and frustrating for customers, leading to a lower AOV. A well-designed website that is easy to navigate, with clear product descriptions and images, can encourage customers to spend more time browsing and ultimately lead to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering personalised product recommendations and easy-to-use search and filter options can help customers find products they are interested in and increase the likelihood of purchasing more items.<\/p>\n<h3>Shipping Costs<\/h3>\n<p>The cost of shipping can also impact your store&#8217;s AOV. High shipping costs can discourage customers from purchasing multiple items, resulting in a lower AOV. Offering free shipping for orders above a certain threshold can encourage customers to purchase more items to reach that threshold, leading to a higher AOV. Additionally, offering fast and reliable shipping options can increase customer satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases, ultimately resulting in a higher AOV.<\/p>\n<h3>Customer Lifetime Value<\/h3>\n<p>If you offer products on a subscription basis and enjoy recurring revenue, along with a solid strategy for retaining repeat customers, you&#8217;re in a great position. This means that you can have a lower average order value (AOV) and allocate more resources towards customer acquisition than brands lacking these features.<\/p>\n<p>The reason is simple: your customer lifetime value is higher than that of brands selling only one product or without a retention strategy. By forecasting that over half of your customers will make repeat purchases or subscribe to a recurring revenue-generating service, you can compute the average lifetime value, which determines the lifetime AOV.<\/p>\n<p>For example, suppose you sell a \u00a310 monthly subscription, and most subscribers stick around for 15 months. In that case, you have a lifetime value of \u00a3150, even if your AOV is just \u00a310. This means you can spend more than \u00a310 to acquire a customer, knowing that you can earn an average of \u00a3150 from that customer over their time with your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>Product Pricing<\/h3>\n<p>The price of your products has a direct impact on your store&#8217;s average order value (AOV). If your prices are too high, customers may not be willing to purchase as much, resulting in a lower AOV. On the other hand, if your prices are too low, customers may not feel the need to purchase additional items, leading to a lower AOV. Finding the right balance is crucial to increasing your AOV. Consider implementing product bundling or offering discounts for purchasing multiple items to encourage customers to spend more.<\/p>\n<p>It may still be worth considering adjusting your pricing strategy to see if you can cover your cost per conversion.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, increasing your subscription price from \u00a310 to \u00a312 may not significantly impact your conversion rate, but it can generate an additional \u00a324 per customer per year, which could cover your acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure that your return on ad spend (ROAS), which is the ratio of cost per conversion to customer lifetime value (CPC:LTV), remains net positive, and the higher the ROAS, the better. Improving your AOV can be an effective method to boost your ROAS because it relies on increasing the amount customers spend during checkout instead of attracting more customers, which can be costly.<\/p>\n<h2>6 Tips to Increase Your Store&#8217;s AOV<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Upselling and cross-selling techniques:<\/strong> Upselling and cross-selling techniques involve suggesting complementary or higher-priced items to customers.
