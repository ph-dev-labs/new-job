Job done right? Well, not quite.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s more that goes into eCommerce shipping than many people realise. In fact, if you\u2019re not factoring in things like taxes, duties, insurance, overheads and any other costs, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as well as the cost of delivery itself<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you could be selling at a loss without realising it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, landed cost is a way of calculating the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">total cost <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of getting a product to your customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you better understand landed cost, here are some of the things that the landed cost of your product(s) may include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original price of your product (incorporating any costs involved in manufacture).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation fees (both domestic and international, if applicable).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duties\/taxes.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tariffs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currency conversion (if applicable).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crating costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handling costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storage.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other overheads.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment processing.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s not even an exhaustive list! But, as you can see, landed cost is definitely something you should be working out if you want to ensure your eCommerce business remains profitable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Tip &#8211; landed cost can also be referred to as \u2018net landed cost\u2019, \u2018landed price\u2019, or \u2018total landed cost\u2019.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important landed cost factors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst that list above looks pretty intimidating, there are some factors that you should focus on more than others. Below, we\u2019ve taken a more detailed look at these important factors for calculating landed cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of goods sold is the cost of a product that you either manufacture or purchase from a supplier. The cost of goods sold includes the cost of raw materials, cost of parts used to make a product, direct labour costs, and overhead costs such as utilities and storage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculating your cost of goods sold for a product will go a long way towards helping you then calculate the landed cost of your product (as figuring out the COGS will encompass many of the cost inputs to your product).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to stress that COGS is not the same as landed cost. Figure out your cost of goods sold, then use that number in your overall landed cost calculation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping can account for a large chunk of the landed cost of your product, so it\u2019s important you include this factor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things to consider when thinking about your shipping costs is the required speed of delivery. As a general rule of thumb, the quicker you need a product to arrive with your customer, the larger the shipping cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it pays to figure out if you\u2019ll be mainly using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/expedited-shipping-explained\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expedited shipping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or regular shipping.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3236\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Shipping-is-only-part-of-landed-cost.jpg\" alt=\"You should calculate the landed cost of your products whether you are sending them domestically or internationally\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Shipping-is-only-part-of-landed-cost.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Shipping-is-only-part-of-landed-cost-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Shipping-is-only-part-of-landed-cost-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/>Taxes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on what you sell from your eCommerce store (and your level of turnover), you may need to charge VAT (usually 20%) on your products. Some eCommerce businesses choose to raise their prices to preserve their profit margin (at the risk of putting some customers off), whilst other eCommerce businesses choose to absorb the cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide to absorb the cost of VAT then you may be able to reduce the impact this has on your eCommerce store by joining HMRC\u2019s flat-rate scheme (where you don\u2019t necessarily have to pay the full 20%), however the scheme only applies to businesses with a turnover under \u00a3150,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever route you choose on VAT, you should factor this into the landed cost of your products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re ordering a large volume of products from a supplier it\u2019s often worth taking out insurance. Equally, it can pay to take out insurance for when you\u2019re shipping a product to a customer (especially if it\u2019s a high value item). But, insurance costs money. So, it\u2019s another factor to consider when calculating the landed cost of your products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also need to think in terms of broader risk too. These can include costs associated with compliance, quality checks, and holding safety stock inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide to ship your products overseas then there is a world of different customs fees and duties you may have to negotiate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customs fees can include duties, taxes, tariffs, levies, brokerage fees, harbour fees and demurrage (storage whilst in custom).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These fees can really add up. There\u2019s also the question as to who pays what. In some instances a customer can end up having to pay a hefty customs bill if you haven\u2019t done your homework beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re going to be shipping internationally on a regular basis, then you should familiarise yourself with INCOTERMS (a set of predefined terms to facilitate international commercial transactions). Other things to know include which countries allow DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), which allows any taxes and duties to be billed back to you, and INTERCOM DAP (Delivered at Place) which shifts the responsibility for duties and taxes to the customer. Understand these and you reduce the likelihood of any nasty surprises for you or your customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whenever you\u2019re going to ship a product internationally, make sure you factor in customs fees into your landed cost calculations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we stated earlier, there are potentially other factors that you should take into account when calculating the landed cost of a product, but in our experience the factors outlined above are the major ones you should take into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When should you calculate landed cost?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a bit of an urban myth circulating on the internet that you only need to calculate the landed cost for products that are being exported internationally.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it\u2019s just that. A myth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should calculate the landed cost for all of your products, whether you are sending them down the road or to the other side of the planet. Try and get into the habit of calculating the landed cost of your products, because as we said at the outset of this article, it can have a major impact upon your profitability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you calculate landed cost?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculating your landed cost can be a challenge, due to the large number of inputs you need to factor in. But, it\u2019s not impossible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to begin calculating the landed cost of a product is to note down the complete journey one of your products takes. From manufacture in the factory, to storage in your warehouse, to finally arriving at a customer\u2019s home. Think about every possible cost that is incurred to you along this journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s then time to do some basic calculations\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A typical landed cost calculation will be as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COGS + Shipping + Taxes + Risk + Customs = Landed Cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Note &#8211; you\u2019ll only need to add customs to this formula if you\u2019re going to be exporting your product overseas.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just do this calculation once. You should try and work through this formula on a regular basis as the costs of certain things may have changed (for example, your shipping costs may have increased, or your COGS may have reduced due to a change in the price of a raw material).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources to help you calculate landed cost<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figuring out the cost of certain factors (such as duties and taxes), can be difficult. However, there are a wealth of resources available online that can make calculating landed cost easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duty calculator<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This handy calculator will help you work out the duty rates for any country and category of product.

But, how?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are few opportunities for reducing the landed cost of your products:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Speak to your suppliers.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you can reduce the cost of the raw materials you use to manufacture your product (or reduce the price you pay for a completed product), then you can reduce your landed cost. This can be one of the more difficult ways of reducing your landed cost, unless there are a large number of different suppliers competing for your business. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider moving your warehouse.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you are able to move your warehouse closer to the main audience for your products, then you can reduce the landed cost of your projects. Unfortunately, this suggestion is not practical for most businesses and the investment required may cancel out any landed cost savings. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Optimise your warehouse processes.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A more practical way of reducing the landed cost of your products is to optimise your warehouse processes.
