But, in recent years a digital-equivalent has been challenging Black Friday for this top position &#8211; Cyber Monday. If you\u2019re an eCommerce store Cyber Monday could be your biggest trading day of the year. You just need to make sure you\u2019re ready for it. <\/span><b><i>Keep reading to discover everything you need to do to get your eCommerce business ready for Cyber Monday.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Cyber Monday?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s begin with a brief history lesson\u2026 The term Cyber Monday was first coined in 2005 to describe the Monday after Black Friday (the date falls between 26th November and 2nd December depending on the year).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It arose as online retailers wanted a share of the Black Friday pie. Whereas Black Friday has traditionally been dominated by large chains etc, Cyber Monday has given smaller, online-only retailers an opportunity to compete and grab a share of this seasonal shopping spree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2005, Cyber Monday has grown massively, with 2020\u2019s Cyber Monday being the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history with a total of $10.7 billion in online spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why eCommerce stores should take Cyber Monday seriously<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past eighteen months have been tumultuous to say the least. With brick and mortar stores battered by Covid-19 restrictions, more and more consumers turned their attention online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With concerns still rife about Covid-19 variants, it seems likely that this year\u2019s Cyber Monday will be the biggest ever as consumers choose to shop at home rather than on the high street.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covid-19 aside, there are numerous other reasons why eCommerce stores should be doing all they can to prepare for Cyber Monday:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">89% of adults in the UK are aware of Cyber Monday.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the peak hour of Cyber Monday 2020, 8pm to 9pm, the buying rate reached \u00a38.5m per minute (via Statistica).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average order value on Cyber Monday 2020 increased by 17% compared to the year before.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020 small eCommerce retailers saw a 501% increase in sales on Cyber Monday compared to the October daily average.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As these stats make clear, eCommerce stores have a lot to gain if they\u2019re ready for Cyber Monday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what do they need to do to prepare? Let\u2019s take a look.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get your eCommerce store ready for Cyber Monday<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From marketing and promotion to planning inventory, arranging your distribution networks and more, we\u2019ve set out the key actions that\u2019ll supercharge your eCommerce store\u2019s Cyber Monday performance below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine what your promotions will be<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, you actually need to have enticing offers for potential and existing customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll be competing against hundreds, if not thousands, of similar competitors for those precious Cyber Monday pounds, so before you do anything else you should figure out what your Cyber Monday promotions are going to be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you going to offer a flat 15% off all products in your store? Will you be running buy one, get one free on selected product lines? Will you be offering certain products at cost price?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you offer, make sure you\u2019re offering something enticing, otherwise your Cyber Monday could quickly become a Blue Monday&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Begin your advertising early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want new and existing customers to know you\u2019re going to have lots of great Cyber Monday deals, you need to tell them!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In advance of Cyber Monday you should start cranking up your marketing activity, using email campaigns, affiliates, paid ads and Google and Bing Shopping to begin driving visitors to your site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set up tracking codes so you can measure the effectiveness of these advertising efforts. You\u2019ll be able to see what actions customers take on your site and attribute revenue to specific advertising channels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By beginning your advertising early, you\u2019ll also have an opportunity to conduct valuable Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) work. This will enable you to identify parts of your site that aren\u2019t performing properly, or areas that are working well and can be replicated elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get your website ready<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3386\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Enliven-your-online-stores-shopping-experience.jpg\" alt=\"How to improve your website for Cyber Monday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1124\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Enliven-your-online-stores-shopping-experience.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Enliven-your-online-stores-shopping-experience-267x300.jpg 267w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Enliven-your-online-stores-shopping-experience-911x1024.jpg 911w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Enliven-your-online-stores-shopping-experience-768x863.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a big one. For want of an actual shop window, your website is your public face during Cyber Monday, so you\u2019ll want to make sure it offers a smooth, easy, compelling experience that encourages shoppers to click the buy button.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the technical to the aesthetic, there are lots of things eCommerce retailers can do to improve their websites ahead of Cyber Monday. We\u2019ve detailed some of the most important actions below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure you have sufficient website infrastructure capacity<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing you want on Cyber Monday is for your website to crash. But that can happen if you don\u2019t have sufficient website infrastructure capacity. This means you not only need to have enough server space to meet demand, but you need to ensure your website\u2019s page loading times remain quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequences of insufficient website infrastructure capacity can be dramatic. Take for example U.S. retailer Nordstrom that saw an 11% drop in sales when their website\u2019s page load time slowed by just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">half a second.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure your website is fit for purpose, make sure you run load tests well in advance of Cyber Monday. Look at previous years\u2019 traffic figures and make an educated guess as to this year\u2019s figures. If you think you\u2019ll be anywhere near your infrastructure\u2019s limits, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upgrade<\/span><\/i><b>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The additional costs of an upgrade will be far outweighed by the losses you\u2019ll incur if your website goes down on Cyber Monday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s an at a glance list of the essential website checks you should carry out before Cyber Monday:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site speed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsive design.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Load testing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checkout functionality.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimise your website for mobile devices<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, mobile transactions on Cyber Monday reached $3 billion. It\u2019s expected that this figure is going to increase, with mobile transactions accounting for a larger share of overall transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should ensure that navigation, mobile responsiveness and the buying process all work on mobile &#8211; if not, get them fixed fast!<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your checkout process is barrier-free<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main reasons for abandoned or failed transactions are poor checkout processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to remember that Cyber Monday shoppers are fickle. Brand loyalty isn\u2019t particularly important to them &#8211; especially when there are thousands of other eCommerce stores vying for their attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your checkout process is a pain, then customers will just give up and go elsewhere. They haven\u2019t got the time or patience to input unnecessary details.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try streamlining your checkout process. Are you asking for too much information? Can you offer multiple payment options such as PayPal or Bitcoin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more you can do to make the checkout process barrier-free, the more transactions you\u2019ll convert.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simulate the in-store experience<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s one barrier that you can\u2019t avoid when it comes to online shopping &#8211; the screen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a brick and mortar store, shoppers can see products close up. They can touch them. They can see how they compare to other items.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all things that are much harder (or impossible) to replicate online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, you should try.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where possible, you should let customers feel like they\u2019re having an immersive shopping experience. Here are some things you can do to bring your online shopping experience to life:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Include photos and videos of your products in different scenarios. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t just include a photo of your product on a plain white background, try putting it into relevant contexts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Build an FAQ page. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some shoppers don\u2019t want the hassle of speaking to a customer service representative and would rather read an answer. So, include an FAQ page on your website.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use a live chat box.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some shoppers prefer to have a text chat to get the answers they need. Chat boxes are now an almost expected part of the online shopping experience, so if you haven\u2019t already got a live chat box on your site, consider installing one. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Make your site interactive.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The more fun and engagement you can create, the more likely someone will stay on your site (and hopefully) make a purchase. Elements such as polls, quizzes, coupon spin wheels all work well.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Write great product descriptions. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product descriptions don\u2019t have to be boring lists of specifications. Make them fun, personable and interesting to read and you\u2019ll find that your sales will increase. There\u2019s a reason copywriting was the original advertising profession!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Recommend products. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is particularly important for shoppers who have landed on your site for the first time. They may not know your full range of products, so be sure to recommend other related products on your product pages. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Compare products.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This can be difficult to get right, but it\u2019s worth the effort. In a physical shop, consumers can quickly and easily compare products. If you\u2019re able to do this on your site, then you\u2019ll increase the likelihood of a conversion.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Send your customer something straight away. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a consumer buys a product in a shop, they get the instant gratification of being able to take their new purchase home immediately. You can try and replicate that sense of instant gratification by sending them something as soon as they\u2019ve made a purchase. It could be a voucher, a small PDF of recipes or even a music track.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your website more \u2018shoppable\u2019 and you\u2019ll benefit on Cyber Monday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3387\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Make-online-payments-as-easy-as-possible-on-Cyber-Monday.jpg\" alt=\"Improving your checkout process will reap dividends on Cyber Monday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Make-online-payments-as-easy-as-possible-on-Cyber-Monday.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Make-online-payments-as-easy-as-possible-on-Cyber-Monday-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Make-online-payments-as-easy-as-possible-on-Cyber-Monday-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate with customers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019ll lose you customers, it\u2019s poor communication.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the Cyber Monday buying journey (pre, during and post purchase) you should communicate clearly and consistently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-purchase, you should be including detailed, clear descriptions on your product pages. Include sizing guides, details about materials, construction, and anything else that will help set shoppers\u2019 expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you have a 2-3 day delivery time for a popular product, say so. And say it clearly! That way you\u2019ll secure purchases from people who are happy to wait for the specified delivery period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-purchase, you should be communicating regularly, providing regular email updates on the progress of their order, and notifying them of any potential delays.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s one rule you should stick to when it comes to customer comms &#8211; you should always contact the customer before they have to contact you. If they\u2019re ringing up asking where their order is, they\u2019re already unhappy with you!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to retain your customers and maximise value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyber Monday will almost certainly be your busiest day of the year. Therefore you should aim to get as much value out of it as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several ways of squeezing value out of Cyber Monday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, it\u2019ll be a day where potentially thousands of people will be buying from you for the first time. If you can retain even a small percentage of these new customers, you\u2019ll be looking at higher revenues in the year ahead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can increase customer retention by adopting the following tactics:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage first time customers to sign up to your email list by offering an exclusive discount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage customers to sign up to a loyalty scheme, making it more likely they\u2019ll make return purchases.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your customer service as good as possible Set KPIs for your team to answer customer enquiries as quickly as possible. Incentivise your staff to go above and beyond in serving customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assess your returns policy. If you make it straightforward to return a product, the more likely customers will be to buy from you again.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as improving customer retention, you can get more value from Cyber Monday by making a concerted effort to increase Average Order Value (AOV).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of it this way. If you\u2019re only going to be seeing such a large volume of traffic once a year, you should make every order during that period as valuable as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can increase the average order value of your customer\u2019s orders by doing the following things:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Offer free shipping at a certain threshold.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Whilst free shipping has a cost for you, the vendor, it has become an expectation amongst holiday shoppers. However, you can make free shipping work for you and increase average order values by only offering it once a specific order amount is reached. Do your sums correctly and you can make free shipping (almost) pay for itself <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase average order value.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Offer a free gift at a certain threshold.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another way of increasing average order value is to offer a free gift once a specific order amount is reached. This not only has the bonus of increasing your revenue, but you can use it as an opportunity to move slow moving items (however, the free gift does actually have to be worthwhile.You can\u2019t just offer anything as a free gift and expect it to increase order values!).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure your inventory, fulfilment and shipping are prepared<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting customers to place an order is only half the work. A major part of Cyber Monday readiness involves getting your inventory, fulfilment and shipping prepared to deal with a large volume of orders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve taken a look at what you can do to prepare across inventory, fulfilment and shipping below.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3388\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eCommerce-stores-should-ensure-they-have-sufficient-shipping-capacity-for-Cyber-Monday.jpg\" alt=\"Does your eCommerce store have enough shipping capacity for Cyber Monday?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eCommerce-stores-should-ensure-they-have-sufficient-shipping-capacity-for-Cyber-Monday.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eCommerce-stores-should-ensure-they-have-sufficient-shipping-capacity-for-Cyber-Monday-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eCommerce-stores-should-ensure-they-have-sufficient-shipping-capacity-for-Cyber-Monday-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/eCommerce-stores-should-ensure-they-have-sufficient-shipping-capacity-for-Cyber-Monday-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should begin by ensuring you actually have enough inventory to fulfil your anticipated sales. Conduct an analysis of last year\u2019s sales figures and inventory. Did you have enough of each product line? Did you rapidly sell out of certain verticals? Apply the lessons you learnt last year to this year\u2019s inventory planning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also want to make sure that inventory is properly set up on your website. Do product pages say you\u2019ve got certain sizes in stock when you haven\u2019t? Then sort it!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking your site\u2019s inventory against your actual inventory can be a tedious process, but it\u2019s absolutely essential to ensure you get the most out of Cyber Monday and don\u2019t leave customers disappointed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you expect certain products to sell out, set up a waitlist option on your website so customers will receive an email notification when their selected items are back in stock. This will also help you generate additional revenue after Cyber Monday.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulfilment<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your fulfilment team (or fulfilment partner) ready to deal with a deluge of Cyber Monday orders?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring you have sufficient warehousing space for inventory and enough staff or temporary staff to deal with quality assessment, picking and packing are just a few of the things you\u2019ll need to do ahead of the big day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you expect a significantly larger volume of orders than you\u2019re used to, then it can be a good idea to partner with a 3PL that\u2019ll be able to take this burden off your hands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyber Monday is not only one of the biggest days of the year for the eCommerce industry. It\u2019s one of the biggest days of the year for shipping companies too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019ve got all of your shipping arrangements sorted way in advance of Cyber Monday. If you suddenly find you don\u2019t have sufficient shipping capacity for all of the orders you\u2019ve received, then you\u2019ll either have to pay exorbitant rates to secure the services of a shipping company at the last minute, or you\u2019ll have to refund those orders. Neither of which is particularly appealing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with fulfilment, if you\u2019re not used to dealing with a large amount of shipping, then it can be much easier (and affordable) to partner with a 3PL that will be able to take care of the end-to-end inventory management, fulfilment and shipping process on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner with 3PL for this year\u2019s Cyber Monday<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to get the most out of this year\u2019s Cyber Monday, then partner with 3PL.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you\u2019ll have discovered in this article, there are myriad things that you need to do to maximise the value you get out of your busiest shopping day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why not leave the inventory management, fulfilment and shipping to the professionals?
