But how can you plan so that you always have stock, that your suppliers are able to deliver, and that you won\u2019t be impacted by manufacturing delays or fluctuations in customer demand? <\/span><b><i>By using the following supply chain forecasting methods, that\u2019s how!<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is supply chain forecasting?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put simply, supply chain forecasting is the use of data, research and feedback to make predictions regarding all aspects of your supply chain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply chain forecasting can cover areas as disparate as production lead time, shipping times, warehouse availability and storage costs, customer demand, staffing and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is supply chain forecasting important?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way of thinking about the importance of supply chain forecasting, is to understand what happens if you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t do it.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to undertake accurate supply chain forecasting can first and foremost have a negative impact on your profitability. But it can also have a series of secondary and tertiary impacts such as running out of inventory, too much inventory, poor customer service, increased shipping fees and much more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply chain forecasting helps you to avoid these problems and maintain a profitable, effective eCommerce business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of data are used in supply chain forecasting?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst there are hundreds, potentially even thousands of different data points that can be used in supply chain forecasting, these data points can generally be classified as one of two types of data; quantitative or qualitative.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what\u2019s the difference between the two types of data?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantitative data<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantitative data involves, as the name suggests, quantifiable things such as past sales numbers, production lead times from previous seasons and other types of \u2018hard\u2019 data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantitative data can be used to formulate quantitative forecasts. Quantitative forecasts are made on the basis that the future will largely mimic the past, so historical data can be used to reliably predict what will happen with your supply chain in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualitative data<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualitative data involves intangible things like anecdotal feedback, surveys, interviews and other types of data that aren\u2019t underpinned by hard facts and figures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people make predictions based on a \u2018gut feel\u2019 or on the basis of anecdotal feedback, they are making qualitative forecasts. Qualitative forecasts are typically made when there isn\u2019t any historical, quantitative data to fall back on. So, things like new product launches will typically be based on qualitative forecasts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3430\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-forecasting-techniques.jpg\" alt=\"What supply chain forecasting techniques are there? \" width=\"900\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-forecasting-techniques.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-forecasting-techniques-300x104.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-forecasting-techniques-768x267.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantitative supply chain forecasting methods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we\u2019ve explored what supply chain forecasting is, why it\u2019s important, and the two core types of data that are used in forecasting, let\u2019s take a look at the most popular types of quantitative supply chain forecasting methods.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this section, we\u2019ll take a look at the following quantitative supply chain forecasting methods:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exponential smoothing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving average forecasting.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple aggregation prediction algorithm.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auto-regressive integrated moving average.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exponential smoothing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exponential smoothing is a form of quantitative forecasting that not only uses historical data, but also takes into account recent observations too (hence the \u2018smoothing\u2019 part of its name).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exponential smoothing produces forecasts that use historical data, but the prediction <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gives more weight to more recent data. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is that you\u2019ll end up with a forecast that is more relevant as it treats newer data as more important than older data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting experts Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos describe exponential smoothing in the following way:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cForecasts produced using exponential smoothing methods are weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. In other words, the more recent the observation the higher the associated weight.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving average forecasting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving average forecasting is one of the simplest forms of quantitative forecasting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving average forecasting uses an average series of subsets from complete data to identify an overall trend. In an eCommerce setting, a moving average forecast can help you identify whether a piece of inventory is selling more or less over time for example.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, because a moving average forecast uses an average, it doesn\u2019t lend any additional weight to more recent data (which may be a better indicator of the future). A moving average forecast also doesn\u2019t take into account seasonality or trends &#8211; important things for eCommerce retailers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Tip &#8211; moving average forecasting is better suited to slower moving, low-volume items of inventory.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple aggregation prediction algorithm<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The multiple aggregation prediction algorithm is a relatively new forecasting method which has been designed primarily to take into account seasonality. The multiple aggregation prediction algorithm also deliberately smooths out trends to prevent you from over or underestimating demand (in other words, you get a clearer long-term picture of demand).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, as this is a relatively new forecasting method, it is still largely unproven in the \u2018real world\u2019 and may be difficult to deploy in an eCommerce context.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auto-regressive integrated moving average<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Held up as one of the most accurate quantitative forecasting methods, the auto-regressive integrated moving average is also one of the most complex, time-consuming and costly forms of supply chain forecasting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An auto-regressive integrated moving average uses time series data to predict future trends. Within the predictive model, the time series data is \u2018smoothed\u2019 using lagged moving averages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because this forecasting method is autoregressive (i.e. it implicitly assumes that the future will resemble the past), it should only be used for forecasting over short time periods. Over longer time periods, market or financial fluctuations can render an auto-regressive integrated moving average prediction false.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3431\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-modelling-for-eCommerce.jpg\" alt=\"How does supply chain modelling for eCommerce work? \" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-modelling-for-eCommerce.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-modelling-for-eCommerce-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Supply-chain-modelling-for-eCommerce-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualitative supply chain forecasting methods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With quantitative forecasting methods out of the way, we\u2019re now into the realm of the qualitative\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we stated earlier, qualitative forecasts are ideal if you find yourself in a situation where you have little or no historical data to work with. Qualitative forecasting methods are also useful in scenarios where historical data may have been rendered obsolete or unreliable (i.e. you can\u2019t use data from 2020 because the COVID-19 pandemic skewed the data).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in this section, we\u2019ll take a look at the following qualitative supply chain forecasting methods:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Delphi method.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales force composition.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market research.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historical analogies.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Delphi method<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Delphi method uses the results of multiple rounds of questionnaires sent to experts, to make a prediction\/forecast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following each round of questionnaires, the panel of experts are presented with an aggregate summary of the previous round so that they can adjust their answers according to the group response.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This enables the experts to collectively work towards an accurate forecast. The Delphi method is valued as a forecasting method as it combines the knowledge of experts with the wisdom of crowds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Delphi method is widely accepted and has been used successfully across many industries, however it has been criticised for not being a falsifiable method (i.e. if two panels receive the same question, they may not reach the same consensus).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales force composition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your sales force can be one of the most valuable sources of information and insight. The sales force composition forecasting method asks for the personal insights and opinions of your sales team during a team exercise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst this forecasting method has the benefit of being fairly straightforward and easy to carry out, studies from the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suggest that it has only poor to fair accuracy in many industries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market research can be a very effective way of conducting your supply chain forecasting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it involves a series of public polls, focus groups or surveys, market research can provide you with the insights you need to effectively plan your supply chain requirements for the next quarter or year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there\u2019s an important caveat to add here. Market research becomes more or less effective depending on the amount of time or money that\u2019s invested. Typically, if you\u2019re only using small sample sizes and not surveying a broad enough spread of people, your market research will not be as useful\/accurate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, large-scale market research, whilst being accurate, can be incredibly costly and time consuming.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historical analogies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose who don\u2019t learn from history are doomed to repeat it\u201d. This famous saying is an accurate way of describing the use of historical analogies for supply chain forecasting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using historical analogies for forecasting essential means that you assume that a new product will have a sales profile similar to a present product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this is a comparative analysis, you need to make sure that you are basing your forecast on a product that is actually similar to your new one. If not, then you can\u2019t really make an accurate forecast.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst historical analogies as forecasts tend to have poor accuracy in the short term, their accuracy has been shown to increase over the longer term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to improve your supply chain forecasting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest, most cost effective way of improving your supply chain forecasting, is to partner with a supply chain expert like 3PL.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/fusion-platform\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3PL Fusion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platform you will build up an incredibly accurate picture of your inventory and order profile, with real-time data and key performance metrics at your fingertips.
