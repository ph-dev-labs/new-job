It was a chance for me to really learn about the business from every angle, warehousing, logistics, delivery \u2013 customer care is about much more than a voice at the end of the phone \u2013 it\u2019s about making sure our customers are looked after from every angle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barry: What did you learn from your time as a 3PL apprentice?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hannah:<\/strong> I learnt that logistics is a very complex service and there are a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/what-are-the-key-factors-to-a-successful-ecommerce-order-fulfilment-process\/\">key factors that go into making order fulfilment a success<\/a>. There is a lot to learn at the start and before I could start to provide great customer service, I had to learn what made our services great.

We like to give our customers answers and solutions fast, so this evolves communication across call and emails. I also act as a direct line of communication into the warehouse team helping to ensure orders are fulfilled in line with customers priorities.<\/p>\n<p>I also act like the customer&#8217;s eyes and ears performing quality checks and reports whenever needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barry: What\u2019s your favourite thing about working at 3PL?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hannah:<\/strong> It has to be speaking to our lovely customers and building relationships with them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barry: What\u2019s the biggest lesson you\u2019ve learnt at 3PL?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hannah:<\/strong> \u2018Focus on solutions\u2019 There is always a solution to every challenge or situation, you just have to do your best to find it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barry: What advice do you have for a future 3PL apprentice?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hannah:<\/strong> Just got for it!
