Why? Because Amazon is one of the world\u2019s largest marketplaces and competition between merchants is fierce. <strong><em>Use the marketing strategies detailed below and you\u2019ll give yourself a huge advantage in 2022\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Get the basics right: Amazon SEO<\/h2>\n<p>One of the easiest, yet most overlooked marketing strategies amongst Amazon merchants is SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Standing for Search Engine Optimisation, SEO involves optimising multiple factors for each of your products to increase the likelihood they will appear in your target customer\u2019s search results.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon, like any other search engine, wants to provide customers with the most relevant products in relation to their searches.<\/p>\n<p>As such, Amazon gives priority to products which tick all of the \u2018SEO boxes\u2019. The latest officially announced algorithm from Amazon is \u2018A9\u2019 (although there have been updates referred to as A10 recently) which takes several signals into account when deciding upon search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>To help you tick those Amazon \u2018A9\u2019 SEO boxes, we\u2019ve set out the things you should be paying attention to below.<\/p>\n<h3>Product title<\/h3>\n<p>This is arguably the most important thing in your product listing; after all, it\u2019s the main thing potential customers will see when searching.<\/p>\n<p>When writing a title it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just include the generic name e.g. laptop stand. Include additional, related, keywords which will help your product appear for broader searches e.g. adjustable ventilated laptop stand for MacBook Pro.<\/p>\n<h3>Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Tagging your products with keywords will help your product show up not just in direct searches, but in \u2018long tail searches\u2019 (such as when a consumer is looking for something very specific).<\/p>\n<p>Amazon allows you to add up to 250 characters on the backend of each product page.<\/p>\n<p>Think carefully about what combination of keywords you choose. Remember, if you\u2019re a small independent merchant, you\u2019ll be unlikely to rank well for very competitive keyword terms. Instead, think of niche groups of keywords that\u2019ll help you \u2018break through\u2019.<\/p>\n<h3>Product descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Good quality product descriptions will not only help make your product more \u2018visible\u2019 from an SEO perspective, but will also help you stand out from the competitors.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen far too many instances of merchants simply copy and pasting generic descriptions on to their product pages. This doesn\u2019t do anyone any favours!<\/p>\n<h3>Images<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to use images! And, when we say images, we mean good quality, clear images that clearly show as much of the product as possible. Show every possible angle and make sure you stick to Amazon\u2019s comprehensive product image guidelines.<\/p>\n<h3>Q&amp;A<\/h3>\n<p>Amazon will favour product pages that have an informative Q&amp;A section. This shows that you are an engaged and proactive seller that is willing to answer a potential customer\u2019s query.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, a Q&amp;A section will be a useful resource in its own right, acting as a \u2018silent salesman\u2019 and helping you to sell your product.<\/p>\n<h2>Affiliate Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve nailed the basic details and ensured that all of your products meet the SEO essentials, you can look at other marketing strategies that can help turbocharge your sales.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most popular and effective of these strategies is Affiliate Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has an incredibly popular affiliate marketing programme which allows the owners of websites, influencers and other content creators to advertise products from Amazon on their platforms.<\/p>\n<p>When people click on these affiliate links and make a purchase, the website owner, influencer or content creator earns a commission.<\/p>\n<p>For merchants, the Amazon affiliate programme is free and simply involves paying a commission to affiliates who successfully generate sales for your business. Commissions can be up to 12% of the product price, but this percentage varies depending on the affiliate, the platform they are linking from and more.<\/p>\n<p>Before embarking on affiliate marketing for your Amazon store, bear in mind that it will likely involve the recruitment and management of a range of affiliate partners. You\u2019ll usually have to negotiate the commission rate and potentially a variety of other factors too. If you\u2019re not up for that, then affiliate marketing probably isn\u2019t for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Amazon Ads<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to go beyond SEO and Affiliate Marketing, then your next step is to engage with Amazon Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon Ads is a platform that allows you to buy adverts to reach new and existing audiences across Amazon and a range of Amazon-owned platforms (such as Fire TV sticks, IMDb.com, Kindles, Freedive and myriad third-party partners and apps).<\/p>\n<p>Amazon Ads allows you to make use of a variety of ad formats to reach new customers. At the time of writing, these ad formats include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sponsored products <\/strong>&#8211; showcasing your individual products in Amazon shopping results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sponsored brand <\/strong>&#8211; showcase your entire brand with adverts that appear in Amazon shopping results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sponsored display<\/strong> &#8211; these display ads provide a visual way of promoting your brand, or an individual product, both on and off Amazon.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Video ads <\/strong>&#8211; place video adverts of your brand or products either on Amazon Prime TV or online on Amazon or Amazon-related websites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Audio ads<\/strong> &#8211; Amazon Music allows you to place audio adverts mid-stream to promote your brand or products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible to buy ads via Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP) which uses programmatic, automated technology to buy ads on your behalf. This takes out much of the manual work traditionally involved with running digital ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>Be prepared for voice search<\/h2>\n<p>With all of the above strategies in place, you\u2019ll be in a great place to dominate your particular niche on Amazon in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>But, are there any unexpected \u2018curveballs\u2019 to look out for next year? Well, yes, there is.<\/p>\n<p>Voice-based search.<\/p>\n<p>Since the launch of Amazon Alexa in 2013, consumers have increasingly been using their smart home device to search for, and order, products.<\/p>\n<p>To put this into perspective, as of 2021, 21% of smart speaker owners have said they have used their devices to shop for items. If you\u2019re not optimising your product listings to take account of voice search, then you could be missing out on custom from a huge chunk of Amazon users!<\/p>\n<p>Smart speakers such as Amazon Alexa use a combination of automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and basic artificial intelligence to serve up results to searchers.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to ensure your products appear for these \u2018voiced\u2019 queries is to engage in voice search SEO (yes, that\u2019s actually a thing).<\/p>\n<h3>Voice search SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Below are some quick, easy-to-implement actions that&#8217;ll help you optimise your Amazon product listings for voice search SEO.<\/p>\n<h4>Use conversational copy<\/h4>\n<p>Because voice search is based on speech, you need to ensure that your product descriptions sound natural and aren\u2019t just rammed full of keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure that you appropriately use semantics and natural syntax to create product copy and it\u2019ll be more likely to appear as a search result.<\/p>\n<h4>Use structured product descriptions<\/h4>\n<p>Think about the kind of questions a searcher is going to be asking, and then structure your product description appropriately.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, put the most important information at the top. Then, use subheadings structured as questions throughout the rest of the product description. This will help the smart speaker to find the right information to provide an answer to the searcher.<\/p>\n<h4>Create a FAQ or Q&amp;A section<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019ve read this far, then you\u2019ll know you should already have an FAQ or Q&amp;A section on each product page just for basic SEO purposes.<\/p>\n<p>However, a well thought out and in-depth Q&amp;A section can help you come out on top for voice searches. This is because Q&amp;A sections generally contain the type of questions people commonly ask smart speakers.<\/p>\n<p>To make sure you\u2019re as optimised as possible, don\u2019t wait for the questions to come to you. Think of every possible question that could be asked about your product, and answer it in the Q&amp;A\/FAQ section.<\/p>\n<h2>Sign up for Amazon FBA or Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP)<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that Amazon is a closed network. If you want to succeed on the platform, then you have to do it on their terms.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst signing up to Amazon FBA or SFP doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll appear at the top of the search results for your products, it certainly helps. Amazon is known to favour merchants that use FBA or SFP over those that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>After all, Amazon gets more of a cut from merchants that use these two services.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t worry.
