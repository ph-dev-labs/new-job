Especially with review sites like Trustpilot being so prominent. So, if you want to provide the very best customer service without breaking the bank, it\u2019s time to start thinking about using an outsourced contact centre service. <strong><em>Keep on reading to find out everything you need to know\u2026<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What is a contact centre?<\/h2>\n<p>A contact centre is a centralised point where all interactions with customers are funnelled and dealt with.<\/p>\n<p>Customers contact businesses in many ways, from telephone calls to emails &#8211; and it\u2019s the job of contact centres to deal with these enquiries &#8211; regardless of the format they take.<\/p>\n<p>Contact centres are typically divided into two distinct types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inbound contact centres.<\/li>\n<li>Outbound contact centres.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inbound contact centres deal with enquiries from customers &#8211; providing advice, information, updates, and dealing with complaints.<\/p>\n<p>Outbound contact centres are those that reach out to individuals &#8211; traditionally by phone.<\/p>\n<p>In an eCommerce context, a contact centre will generally combine both of these functions &#8211; dealing with inbound enquiries from customers, and providing outbound communications, for example letting customers know about a change in the status of their order.<\/p>\n<h2>What is contact centre outsourcing?<\/h2>\n<p>Contact centre outsourcing refers to the scenario in which an eCommerce business partners with a third party who will run their contact centre on their behalf.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, rather than going to the time and expense of setting up a contact centre in-house, an eCommerce brand chooses an outside company to deal with their inbound and outbound customer service requirements.<\/p>\n<h2>The advantages of contact centre outsourcing<\/h2>\n<p>Outsourcing your contact centre requirements can have a number of benefits for eCommerce brands. This is especially true if your eCommerce brand is in the early stages of growth and development.<\/p>\n<p>Below, you\u2019ll find the top benefits of contact centre outsourcing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It\u2019s cost-effective<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Setting up a dedicated contact centre isn\u2019t cheap. You need to pay for staff, equipment, software, and office space (and that\u2019s just for starters!).<\/p>\n<p>These are a mix of upfront and ongoing costs &#8211; which tie up a lot of your capital. This is capital which could often be better used on activities that\u2019ll further grow your business, such as sales and marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>By outsourcing your contact centre to a third party, you\u2019ll be able to benefit from great customer service, but at a fraction of the cost of setting up a contact centre in-house.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>It improves customer experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a rapidly growing eCommerce brand, then you\u2019re probably struggling to stay on top of the amount of customer enquiries you\u2019re receiving.<\/p>\n<p>This can lead to a sour taste in many consumers\u2019 mouths.<\/p>\n<p>With large eCommerce brands being able to provide answers to customer queries around the clock, customers have become used to getting relevant, comprehensive answers <strong>quickly<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If your brand is to compete in the crowded eCommerce space, you need to be able to respond to customers in the same timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing your contact centre allows you to do just that.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Access to expertise<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Handling customer enquiries &#8211; especially varied enquiries &#8211; is a specialist skill.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a skill that you and your internal team may not be particularly adept at. This is why it makes sense to outsource your contact centre to a specialist.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way; a third party contact centre provider is focused <em>solely<\/em> on dealing with customer enquiries. They\u2019ll have the experience, systems, processes, and people to deal with large volumes of enquiries professionally.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s something that would take you and your internal team likely years to develop.<\/p>\n<p>Third party contact centres also tend to have advanced data collection tools and will be able to provide you with detailed analytics such as average wait times, the number of different types of enquiries and more.<\/p>\n<p>These can be incredibly valuable insights and, again, aren\u2019t something you\u2019d necessarily be able to develop in-house.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Improved customer retention<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>According to a survey conducted by Gravy Solutions, 69% of people shop more frequently with brands that offer consistent customer service.<\/p>\n<p>By outsourcing your contact centre, you can capture that 69% of people, with consistently good customer service.<\/p>\n<p>Third party contact centres are incentivised to offer the very best customer service &#8211; plus, you can quantify this by asking them to report on KPIs around customer satisfaction and retention.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Improved availability<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Related to the above point, outsourced contact centres can improve your customer retention rate simply because they make you more available to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>What we mean by this, is that outsourced contact centres can be available 24-7 (or at least extended hours), so your customers can get the answers they want at any time of day.<\/p>\n<p>This puts you on a similar footing to the very biggest eCommerce brands like Amazon, where customers return time after time because they can always get an answer about their orders\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>The disadvantages of contact centre outsourcing<\/h2>\n<p>Like any form of outsourcing, contact centre outsourcing does have a few disadvantages. We\u2019ve outlined these drawbacks below.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Less control<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re very concerned over controlling your brand\u2019s messaging, then outsourcing your contact centre can diminish your level of control.<\/p>\n<p>This is only a minor drawback, however, as many third party contact centre providers will work closely with you to establish things like tone of voice, the key messages that need to be conveyed etc.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lack of industry knowledge<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a universal drawback, but rather a note of warning.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t select the right third party contact centre provider, then you may find they don\u2019t have the detailed industry knowledge that is needed to provide a proper level of service to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>This can be solved by only working with a third party contact centre that can provide a demonstrated track record of working in your industry.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lack of qualitative feedback<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Third party contact centres will be able to provide you with detailed analytics regarding call volumes and types. However, they may not be able to provide you with qualitative feedback, such as customer comments on the quality of your service or products.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t necessarily the end of the world though, as it\u2019s possible for eCommerce brands to gather this qualitative feedback through other channels such as email surveys, social media platforms and on-site chatbots.<\/p>\n<h2>How outsourcing your contact centre can enhance the customer experience<\/h2>\n<p>As we\u2019ve just seen, contact centre outsourcing comes with a whole host of benefits.
