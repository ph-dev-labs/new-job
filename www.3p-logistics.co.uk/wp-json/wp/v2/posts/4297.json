Then there\u2019s one particular skill that can help you achieve this &#8211; demand forecasting. To find out more about demand forecasting and how to apply it in your business, keep reading\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>What is eCommerce demand forecasting?<\/h2>\n<p>eCommerce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/demand-forecasting\/\">demand forecasting<\/a> refers to the process of predicting future demand for your products.<\/p>\n<p>Demand forecasting can cover your entire inventory, be it products which you\u2019ve been selling for years, or new products that you\u2019re thinking about stocking.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to create a demand forecast using a number of sources, however the most common source of data is historical sales records &#8211; which are typically drawn from an eCommerce business\u2019 order management system.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is eCommerce demand forecasting important?<\/h2>\n<p>As you\u2019ll be aware &#8211; running an eCommerce business, particularly one that is growing or at scale &#8211; is a complex, challenging affair.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are you likely to have lots of inventory to deal with, but you\u2019ll have the challenge of fulfilling orders to different parts of the country, dealing with supply chain disruptions and more.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention your competitors! Today\u2019s eCommerce industry is becoming more competitive than ever. You not only have to compete with the giants such as Amazon, but a continual influx of new start-ups too.<\/p>\n<p>That all adds up to a scenario where the answer is demand forecasting.<\/p>\n<p>Demand forecasting can help you to avoid the mistakes that can result in your customers going elsewhere and your business failing to grow.<\/p>\n<p>The types of mistakes that demand forecasting can help you avoid, include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running out of stock during peak sales periods, losing you valuable customers.<\/li>\n<li>Overspending on inventory that doesn\u2019t sell &#8211; leaving you with valuable capital tied up in stock.<\/li>\n<li>Struggling with cash flow as a result of capital being tied up in slow moving items of inventory.<\/li>\n<li>Having to spend too much on overheads due to incorrect inventory allocation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What are the different types of eCommerce demand forecasting?<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the scale of your eCommerce business, the retail niche you work in, and the markets you serve, different types of eCommerce demand forecasts will be more suitable for you.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we\u2019ve detailed some of the most common types of eCommerce demand forecasting by level and time.<\/p>\n<h3>Macro-level<\/h3>\n<p>A macro-level demand forecast examines future demand in the broadest possible way.<\/p>\n<p>This type of forecast examines the wider market and economic conditions in which an eCommerce business is operating. Such a forecast will consider things like inflation, consumer confidence, government fiscal policy and more.<\/p>\n<p>Because macro-level demand forecasts are so broad &#8211; and encompass so many varying factors &#8211; they are more suited to larger businesses which are able to fund this level of market research.<\/p>\n<h3>Micro-level<\/h3>\n<p>A micro-level demand forecast is one that takes a \u2018deep-dive\u2019 into an individual eCommerce company\u2019s operations and performance.<\/p>\n<p>This type of demand forecast understands that individual eCommerce firms can do very little to influence macro factors, and instead focuses on things that a firm <em>can influence.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Factors that will be taken into account in a micro-level demand forecast include past sales performance of key categories, profit margins of individual items, and the cost of production and cash flow and how these things impact inventory.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from demand forecasts that take either a broad or very narrow view, there are also demand forecasts that look at differing lengths of time. These are short-term and long-term demand forecasts.<\/p>\n<h3>Short-term<\/h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, a short-term demand forecast looks at potential demand over a shorter period of time &#8211; typically looking at a three to 12-month period.<\/p>\n<p>Short-term demand forecasts are particularly good for businesses that are affected by seasonality. For example, if you sell tents and outdoor equipment, a forecast will look ahead to the next summer &#8211; having looked at the previous summer\u2019s sales data to determine how much stock will be needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Long-term<\/h3>\n<p>A long\u2013term demand forecast will normally attempt to anticipate demand anywhere from 12 months to three years ahead.<\/p>\n<p>One of the major reasons for conducting a long-term demand forecast is to determine whether you should introduce new products and product lines into your business. Likewise, a long-term demand forecast will examine whether your business needs to adopt new sales channels.<\/p>\n<p>Because this type of forecast is covering a longer period of time, it\u2019s better able to observe changes in consumer purchasing habits and trends.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re thinking about social commerce (e.g. selling directly to consumers through platforms like TikTok and Instagram), then a long-term forecast can help you determine whether this will be a worthwhile investment or not.<\/p>\n<h2>How to conduct a demand forecast for your eCommerce business<\/h2>\n<p>As you have read so far, conducting a demand forecast is certainly a worthwhile exercise for the majority of eCommerce brands. But, if you want to conduct one, what are the next steps?<\/p>\n<h3>Select targets<\/h3>\n<p>Before you dive in and start pulling months and years of sales data from your systems, you should first set some targets; in other words, think about the questions you want the forecast to answer.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified these questions and targets, you can start crafting a forecast that actually helps to answer them.<\/p>\n<h3>Collect and save data<\/h3>\n<p>The foundation of any successful forecast is good, clean, accurate data. If you\u2019re going to effectively answer the questions you set out earlier, you\u2019re going to need the data that\u2019ll provide the answers.<\/p>\n<p>The most important data for your forecast will be your sales data. Accessing this data is usually as straightforward as downloading it from your CRM or order management platform.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, though, that a good forecast will also look at wider trends &#8211; including competitors, the wider market, the economy &#8211; so remember to include some of this data from outside your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Data analysis<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gathered all of your data, it\u2019s time to analyse it.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a smaller eCommerce company, then it should be possible to do this manually, using spreadsheets and charts to identify key sales\/demand trends.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re a very large eCommerce company, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll need to call in the services of a professional data analyst to help you manipulate and handle the data to yield useful insights and trends.<\/p>\n<h3>Ongoing adjustments<\/h3>\n<p>Having completed your forecast, you want to make sure it doesn\u2019t sit on a shelf gathering dust.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you want to put your money where your mouth is, and start implementing changes within your business based on the forecast.<\/p>\n<p>So, if your forecast indicates falling demand for a particular line of products, make sure your reorder points are changed so that you keep less of that particular item in stock.<\/p>\n<p>Implementing your forecast can certainly be daunting, but the other option &#8211; working based on sheer guesswork &#8211; is far worse!<\/p>\n<h2>Ensure your inventory and fulfilment is on point with 3PL<\/h2>\n<p>You may have created the finest demand forecast in the world, but if you struggle to manage your inventory and process and fulfil orders efficiently, you may as well not have a forecast!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to stay on top of your inventory and fulfilment, then why not consider outsourcing it to an expert third-party logistics business like 3PL?<\/p>\n<p>We take away the hassle of managing your own inventory and fulfilment so that you can focus on what you do best &#8211; marketing and selling your awesome products!<\/p>\n<p>Sounds interesting?
