The changes are designed to strengthen the internal market and ensure fair competition with non-European traders.<\/span><b><i> If you want to make sure that your eCommerce business is ready for these changes, keep reading.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the current situation for distance selling in the EU?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s likely you run and\/or own an eCommerce store. Under the current regulations if you are only active in the UK, then you use a UK VAT number, submit your declarations in the UK and you\u2019ll be aware of the UK VAT rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sell to EU member states then you currently have to register separately for VAT in each country you sell to. This arrangement is known as \u2018place of supply\u2019 or the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">destination <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">principle. Registering to pay VAT in European countries currently depends on if you meet distance selling thresholds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU distance selling thresholds are as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u20ac10,000 per annum: Germany; the Netherlands; and, Luxembourg.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all of the remaining EU member states, the distance selling threshold is \u20ac35,000 per annum (or local currency equivalent if they don\u2019t use the Euro).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the current regulations, things can get very complicated, very quickly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re selling your goods to private individuals in 10 different European countries then you may have to submit 10 different VAT returns, keep 10 different sets of VAT accounts, all in languages and according to customs you may not be familiar with.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in order to make life easier for eCommerce retailers who want to sell into the EU from outside of it (and between countries within the EU), the European Commission has decided to simplify VAT rules.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Commission, the changes are designed to achieve three aims:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modernise VAT rules in recognition of the huge growth of eCommerce.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simplify VAT obligations for eCommerce stores.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tackle VAT fraud and level the playing field for European and non-European businesses alike.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the new EU VAT changes for eCommerce businesses?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new EU VAT reforms take the shape of three distinct changes. We\u2019ve detailed these below to help you understand what you may need to do to continue (or start) selling to consumers in the European Union.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The introduction of a single EU VAT return for eCommerce distance selling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an attempt to make the lives of eCommerce businesses easier, the new EU VAT reforms will see the existing distance selling thresholds withdrawn and replaced with a single EU VAT return known as One Stop Shop (OSS).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The One Stop Shop takes the form of an electronic portal that businesses can use to comply with their VAT obligations on eCommerce sales to consumers within the EU. The OSS filing is in addition to a business\u2019s regular domestic VAT return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that there will be two different versions of the OSS. The OSS for EU member states and the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) for non-EU member states.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1st July, non-EU states will be able to register on the Import One Stop Shop. The IOSS is to be used by non-EU businesses that are selling \u2018low-value\u2019 goods of up to \u20ac150 to consumers in the EU. Before registering with the IOSS though, non-EU businesses must first register as a \u2018non-Union\u2019 taxpayer with the tax authority of any EU member state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once registered in a EU member state and registered on the OSS, the portal will allow eCommerce businesses to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declare and pay VAT due on all sales in a single electronic quarterly return.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declare VAT incurred on imports.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once registered, UK eCommerce businesses will be able to use the OSS to report their sales by EU country, see the VAT % rate in each country, and VAT due in each country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OSS filing should be made by businesses on the same date as their VAT return is due in the EU member state in which they are registered. The tax authority of that EU member state will then be responsible for dividing-up and paying the VAT received from your business to the applicable countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OSS is an extension of the 2015 Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS), which successfully trialled a single EU VAT return system for the B2C sales of digital, telecoms and broadcast services e.g. streaming media, e-books, apps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Note &#8211; if you hold stocks in warehouses in EU states, you will still have to be VAT registered in those states. This also includes eCommerce stores that use the Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) programme. There will, however, be exemptions for sellers using marketplaces.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3279 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-EU-is-introducing-new-changes-to-VAT-that-will-impact-ecommerce-businesses-e1620923317982.jpg\" alt=\"How will the EU's VAT changes impact UK eCommerce businesses?\" width=\"900\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-EU-is-introducing-new-changes-to-VAT-that-will-impact-ecommerce-businesses-e1620923317982.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-EU-is-introducing-new-changes-to-VAT-that-will-impact-ecommerce-businesses-e1620923317982-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-EU-is-introducing-new-changes-to-VAT-that-will-impact-ecommerce-businesses-e1620923317982-768x428.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removal of the small consignment relief<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another change that should be noted keenly by eCommerce businesses is the European Union\u2019s intention to abolish the small consignment relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the current regulations goods that are worth \u20ac22 or less are currently <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exempt <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from VAT, whilst goods valued between \u20ac23 and \u20ac150 are subject to VAT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 1st July 2021, goods of \u20ac22 or less will also be subject to VAT.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What this means for businesses such as yours is that you must charge VAT at the time of sale (at the % rate of VAT in the customer\u2019s country). You will be able to use the customer\u2019s delivery address to determine the country VAT rate. By doing this, no VAT will be due at the point of import (customs).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This VAT must be declared and paid via the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS). Once a declaration has been made on the IOSS, you will be issued with a unique IOSS identification number which you should include on all packages that you are sending to customers in the EU. This number will demonstrate to customs authorities that you have properly declared the VAT that is due. An IOSS identification number will be crucial to prevent hold ups in customs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By following this process, the EU says that UK eCommerce businesses registered on the IOSS will benefit from a quick, easy \u2018Green Channel\u2019 customs clearance process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of IOSS in action<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realise that these changes can be quite a lot to take in. But it\u2019s important that eCommerce businesses get to grips with them, otherwise your business with EU-based consumers could be severely disrupted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, let\u2019s take a look at what the process is at present for a fictional business (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boot It<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a purveyor of quality footwear), and what it\u2019ll be like after 1st July 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Current EU VAT regulations<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boot It can sell and send consignments under \u20ac22 to EU consumers without incurring any VAT charges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they sell a pair of boots over that limit (up to a value of \u20ac150), then either the customer or Boot It will have to pay import VAT at the rate of the country of import. Because Boot It wants to provide an excellent service, they choose to absorb the cost of the import VAT on behalf of their customers.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>New EU VAT regulations from 1st July 2021 and beyond<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the EU\u2019s new VAT arrangements for eCommerce stores, Boot It will charge VAT at the point of sale (using the customer&#8217;s delivery address to calculate the % VAT due).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will then make a declaration on the IOSS (provided the product is less than \u20ac150).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means Boot It is then exempted from paying import VAT at customs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Boot It sells a pair of boots that cost more than \u20ac150, then they must pay import VAT at customs.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketplaces to become the deemed supplier and VAT collector<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the EU\u2019s new VAT regulations, online marketplaces (under certain circumstances) will be deemed to be the supplier, and thus VAT collector, of online sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To go into those \u2018certain circumstances\u2019 in further detail, the EU will specifically be deeming marketplaces as the supplier and VAT collector where they facilitate cross-border sales to consumers via third parties (this is referred to as the \u2018full liability scheme\u2019).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what does the EU mean by \u2018facilitating\u2019?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU defines facilitators as \u2018electronic platforms assisting sellers and consumers to come together and strike a contract for the supply of goods on a cross-border basis\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EU will apply the new deemed supplier regulations in the following instances:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where a marketplace is facilitating the import of goods up to \u20ac150.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distance selling cross-border or domestic transactions of any value for non-EU sellers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the regulations, there is an option for marketplaces to opt out of the scheme and transfer the VAT obligations to the delivery company of the seller.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is a marketplace deemed not to be responsible for collecting VAT? A marketplace is deemed to be not responsible when it only provides the following services in relation to a sale:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment processing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listing or advertising the products.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redirecting customers to other marketplaces where the goods are offered without any further direct involvement in the sale.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketplaces will also have new reporting responsibilities as part of the regulations. They will be required to record information about sellers\u2019 transactions in sufficient detail that tax authorities in the country of the customer can check that VAT has been correctly paid. Marketplaces will also have to hold these records electronically for at least 10 years after the year of the transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Note &#8211; while marketplaces that are deemed to be \u2018facilitators\u2019 will be responsible for collecting VAT, they will not take on any product liability or regulatory obligations in regards to the goods sold.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s clear then, that UK-based eCommerce businesses will be impacted by the EU\u2019s new eCommerce VAT changes. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the time to prepare is <\/span><\/i><b><i>now<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information about how you can improve your fulfilment process to EU-based customers, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/contact\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speak to 3PL today<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Find more eCommerce information and advice on the <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/\"><b>3PL blog<\/b><\/a><b>\u2026<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/brexit-2021-prepare-your-ecommerce-business-now-for-these-new-rules\/\"><b>Brexit 2021: Prepare Your eCommerce Business Now For These New Rules<\/b><\/a><b> | <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/important-update-shipping-to-the-eu-northern-ireland-after-brexit\/\"><b>Shipping to the EU &amp; Northern Ireland After Brexit<\/b><\/a><b> | <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3p-logistics.co.uk\/3pl-blog\/faults-in-your-fulfilment-could-be-costing-you-money-heres-how-to-fix-it\/\"><b>Faults in Your Fulfilment Could Be Costing You Money.
